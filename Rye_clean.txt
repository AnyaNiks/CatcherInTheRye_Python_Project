if you really want to hear about it the first thing you ll probably want to know is

where i was born an what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were

occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i

don t feel like going into it if you want to know the truth in the first place that stuff

bores me and in the second place my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece

if i told anything pretty personal about them they re quite touchy about anything like

that especially my father they re nice and all i m not saying that but they re also

touchy as hell besides i m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or

anything i ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last

christmas just before i got pretty run down and had to come out here and take it easy i

mean that s all i told d b about and he s my brother and all he s in hollywood that

isn t too far from this crumby place and he comes over and visits me practically every

week end he s going to drive me home when i go home next month maybe he just got a

jaguar one of those little english jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour it

cost him damn near four thousand bucks he s got a lot of dough now he didn t use to

he used to be just a regular writer when he was home he wrote this terrific book of

short stories the secret goldfish in case you never heard of him the best one in it was

the secret goldfish it was about this little kid that wouldn t let anybody look at his

goldfish because he d bought it with his own money it killed me now he s out in

hollywood d b being a prostitute if there s one thing i hate it s the movies don t even

mention them to me

where i want to start telling is the day i left pencey prep pencey prep is this

school that s in agerstown pennsylvania you probably heard of it you ve probably seen

the ads anyway they advertise in about a thousand magazines always showing some

hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence like as if all you ever did at pencey was

play polo all the time i never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place and

underneath the guy on the horse s picture it always says since 1888 we have been

molding boys into splendid clear thinking young men strictly for the birds they don t

do any damn more molding at pencey than they do at any other school and i didn t know

anybody there that was splendid and clear thinking and all maybe two guys if that

many and they probably came to pencey that way

anyway it was the saturday of the football game with saxon hall the game

with saxon hall was supposed to be a very big deal around pencey it was the last game

of the year and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old pencey didn t

win i remember around three o clock that afternoon i was standing way the hell up on

top of thomsen hill right next to this crazy cannon that was in the revolutionary war

and all you could see the whole field from there and you could see the two teams

bashing each other all over the place you couldn t see the grandstand too hot but you

could hear them all yelling deep and terrific on the pencey side because practically the

whole school except me was there and scrawny and faggy on the saxon hall side

because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them

there were never many girls at all at the football games only seniors were

allowed to bring girls with them it was a terrible school no matter how you looked at it

i like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while even

if they re only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or

something old selma thurmer she was the headmaster s daughter showed up at the

games quite often but she wasn t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire she

was a pretty nice girl though i sat next to her once in the bus from agerstown and we

sort of struck up a conversation i liked her she had a big nose and her nails were all

bitten down and bleedy looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the

place but you felt sort of sorry for her what i liked about her she didn t give you a lot of

horse manure about what a great guy her father was she probably knew what a phony

slob he was

the reason i was standing way up on thomsen hill instead of down at the game

was because i d just got back from new york with the fencing team i was the goddam

manager of the fencing team very big deal we d gone in to new york that morning for

this fencing meet with mcburney school only we didn t have the meet i left all the

foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway it wasn t all my fault i had to keep

getting up to look at this map so we d know where to get off so we got back to pencey

around two thirty instead of around dinnertime the whole team ostracized me the whole

way back on the train it was pretty funny in a way

the other reason i wasn t down at the game was because i was on my way to say

good by to old spencer my history teacher he had the grippe and i figured i probably

wouldn t see him again till christmas vacation started he wrote me this note saying he

wanted to see me before i went home he knew i wasn t coming back to pencey

i forgot to tell you about that they kicked me out i wasn t supposed to come

back after christmas vacation on account of i was flunking four subjects and not applying

myself and all they gave me frequent warning to start applying myself especially

around midterms when my parents came up for a conference with old thurmer but i

didn t do it so i got the ax they give guys the ax quite frequently at pencey it has a

very good academic rating pencey it really does

anyway it was december and all and it was cold as a witch s teat especially on

top of that stupid hill i only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything the week

before that somebody d stolen my camel s hair coat right out of my room with my fur

lined gloves right in the pocket and all pencey was full of crooks quite a few guys came

from these very wealthy families but it was full of crooks anyway the more expensive a

school is the more crooks it has i m not kidding anyway i kept standing next to that

crazy cannon looking down at the game and freezing my ass off only i wasn t watching

the game too much what i was really hanging around for i was trying to feel some kind

of a good by i mean i ve left schools and places i didn t even know i was leaving them i

hate that i don t care if it s a sad good by or a bad goodby but when i leave a place i like

to know i m leaving it if you don t you feel even worse

i was lucky all of a sudden i thought of something that helped make me know i

was getting the hell out i suddenly remembered this time in around october that i and

robert tichener and paul campbell were chucking a football around in front of the

academic building they were nice guys especially tichener it was just before dinner

and it was getting pretty dark out but we kept chucking the ball around anyway it kept

getting darker and darker and we could hardly see the ball any more but we didn t want

to stop doing what we were doing finally we had to this teacher that taught biology

mr zambesi stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to

go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner if i get a chance to remember that kind of

stuff i can get a good by when i need one at least most of the time i can as soon as i

got it i turned around and started running down the other side of the hill toward old

spencer s house he didn t live on the campus he lived on anthony wayne avenue

i ran all the way to the main gate and then i waited a second till i got my breath i

have no wind if you want to know the truth i m quite a heavy smoker for one thing that

is i used to be they made me cut it out another thing i grew six and a half inches last

year that s also how i practically got t b and came out here for all these goddam

checkups and stuff i m pretty healthy though

anyway as soon as i got my breath back i ran across route 204 it was icy as hell

and i damn near fell down i don t even know what i was running for i guess i just felt

like it after i got across the road i felt like i was sort of disappearing it was that kind of

a crazy afternoon terrifically cold and no sun out or anything and you felt like you were

disappearing every time you crossed a road

boy i rang that doorbell fast when i got to old spencer s house i was really

frozen my ears were hurting and i could hardly move my fingers at all c mon c mon

i said right out loud almost somebody open the door finally old mrs spencer

opened it they didn t have a maid or anything and they always opened the door

themselves they didn t have too much dough

holden mrs spencer said how lovely to see you come in dear are you

frozen to death i think she was glad to see me she liked me at least i think she did

boy did i get in that house fast how are you mrs spencer i said how s mr

spencer

let me take your coat dear she said she didn t hear me ask her how mr

spencer was she was sort of deaf

she hung up my coat in the hall closet and i sort of brushed my hair back with

my hand i wear a crew cut quite frequently and i never have to comb it much how ve

you been mrs spencer i said again only louder so she d hear me

i ve been just fine holden she closed the closet door how have you been

the way she asked me i knew right away old spencer d told her i d been kicked out

fine i said how s mr spencer he over his grippe yet

over it holden he s behaving like a perfect i don t know what he s in his

room dear go right in

they each had their own room and all they were both around seventy years old

or even more than that they got a bang out of things though in a haif assed way of

course i know that sounds mean to say but i don t mean it mean i just mean that i used

to think about old spencer quite a lot and if you thought about him too much you

wondered what the heck he was still living for i mean he was all stooped over and he

had very terrible posture and in class whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the

blackboard some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to

him that s awful in my opinion but if you thought about him just enough and not too

much you could figure it out that he wasn t doing too bad for himself for instance one

sunday when some other guys and i were over there for hot chocolate he showed us this

old beat up navajo blanket that he and mrs spencer d bought off some indian in

yellowstone park you could tell old spencer d got a big bang out of buying it that s

what i mean you take somebody old as hell like old spencer and they can get a big

bang out of buying a blanket

his door was open but i sort of knocked on it anyway just to be polite and all i

could see where he was sitting he was sitting in a big leather chair all wrapped up in

that blanket i just told you about he looked over at me when i knocked who s that he

yelled caulfield come in boy he was always yelling outside class it got on your

nerves sometimes

the minute i went in i was sort of sorry i d come he was reading the atlantic

monthly and there were pills and medicine all over the place and everything smelled

like vicks nose drops it was pretty depressing i m not too crazy about sick people

anyway what made it even more depressing old spencer had on this very sad ratty old

bathrobe that he was probably born in or something i don t much like to see old guys in

their pajamas and bathrobes anyway their bumpy old chests are always showing and

their legs old guys legs at beaches and places always look so white and unhairy

hello sir i said i got your note thanks a lot he d written me this note asking me to

stop by and say good by before vacation started on account of i wasn t coming back

you didn t have to do all that i d have come over to say good by anyway

have a seat there boy old spencer said he meant the bed

i sat down on it how s your grippe sir

m boy if i felt any better i d have to send for the doctor old spencer said that

knocked him out he started chuckling like a madman then he finally straightened

himself out and said why aren t you down at the game i thought this was the day of the

big game

it is i was only i just got back from new york with the fencing team i said

boy his bed was like a rock

he started getting serious as hell i knew he would so you re leaving us eh he

said

yes sir i guess i am

he started going into this nodding routine you never saw anybody nod as much

in your life as old spencer did you never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was

thinking and all or just because he was a nice old guy that didn t know his ass from his

elbow

what did dr thurmer say to you boy i understand you had quite a little chat

yes we did we really did i was in his office for around two hours i guess

what d he say to you

oh well about life being a game and all and how you should play it

according to the rules he was pretty nice about it i mean he didn t hit the ceiling or

anything he just kept talking about life being a game and all you know

life is a game boy life is a game that one plays according to the rules

yes sir i know it is i know it

game my ass some game if you get on the side where all the hot shots are then

it s a game all right i ll admit that but if you get on the other side where there aren t

any hot shots then what s a game about it nothing no game has dr thurmer written

to your parents yet old spencer asked me

he said he was going to write them monday

have you yourself communicated with them

no sir i haven t communicated with them because i ll probably see them

wednesday night when i get home

and how do you think they ll take the news

well they ll be pretty irritated about it i said they really will this is about

the fourth school i ve gone to i shook my head i shake my head quite a lot boy i

said i also say boy quite a lot partly because i have a lousy vocabulary and partly

because i act quite young for my age sometimes i was sixteen then and i m seventeen

now and sometimes i act like i m about thirteen it s really ironical because i m six foot

two and a half and i have gray hair i really do the one side of my head the right side

is full of millions of gray hairs i ve had them ever since i was a kid and yet i still act

sometimes like i was only about twelve everybody says that especially my father it s

partly true too but it isn t all true people always think something s all true i don t give a

damn except that i get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age sometimes i

act a lot older than i am i really do but people never notice it people never notice

anything

old spencer started nodding again he also started picking his nose he made out

like he was only pinching it but he was really getting the old thumb right in there i guess

he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room i didn t care

except that it s pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose

then he said i had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had

their little chat with dr thurmer some weeks ago they re grand people

yes they are they re very nice

grand there s a word i really hate it s a phony i could puke every time i hear it

then all of a sudden old spencer looked like he had something very good

something sharp as a tack to say to me he sat up more in his chair and sort of moved

around it was a false alarm though all he did was lift the atlantic monthly off his lap

and try to chuck it on the bed next to me he missed it was only about two inches away

but he missed anyway i got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed all of a

sudden then i wanted to get the hell out of the room i could feel a terrific lecture coming

on i didn t mind the idea so much but i didn t feel like being lectured to and smell vicks

nose drops and look at old spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time i

really didn t

it started all right what s the matter with you boy old spencer said he said it

pretty tough too for him how many subjects did you carry this term

five sir

five and how many are you failing in

four i moved my ass a little bit on the bed it was the hardest bed i ever sat on

i passed english all right i said because i had all that beowulf and lord randal my

son stuff when i was at the whooton school i mean i didn t have to do any work in

english at all hardly except write compositions once in a while

he wasn t even listening he hardly ever listened to you when you said

something

i flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing

i know that sir boy i know it you couldn t help it

absolutely nothing he said over again that s something that drives me crazy

when people say something twice that way after you admit it the first time then he said

it three times but absolutely nothing i doubt very much if you opened your textbook

even once the whole term did you tell the truth boy

well i sort of glanced through it a couple of times i told him i didn t want to

hurt his feelings he was mad about history

you glanced through it eh he said very sarcastic your ah exam paper is

over there on top of my chiffonier on top of the pile bring it here please

it was a very dirty trick but i went over and brought it over to him i didn t have

any alternative or anything then i sat down on his cement bed again boy you can t

imagine how sorry i was getting that i d stopped by to say good by to him

he started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something we studied

the egyptians from november 4th to december 2nd he said you chose to write about

them for the optional essay question would you care to hear what you had to say

no sir not very much i said

he read it anyway though you can t stop a teacher when they want to do

something they just do it

the egyptians were an ancient race of caucasians residing in

one of the northern sections of africa the latter as we all

know is the largest continent in the eastern hemisphere

i had to sit there and listen to that crap it certainly was a dirty trick

the egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for

various reasons modern science would still like to know what

the secret ingredients were that the egyptians used when they

wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for

innumerable centuries this interesting riddle is still quite

a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century

he stopped reading and put my paper down i was beginning to sort of hate him

your essay shall we say ends there he said in this very sarcastic voice you wouldn t

think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all however you dropped me a little

note at the bottom of the page he said

i know i did i said i said it very fast because i wanted to stop him before he

started reading that out loud but you couldn t stop him he was hot as a firecracker

dear mr spencer he read out loud that is all i know about

the egyptians i can t seem to get very interested in them

although your lectures are very interesting it is all right

with me if you flunk me though as i am flunking everything

else except english anyway

respectfully yours holden caulfield

he put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he d just beaten hell

out of me in ping pong or something i don t think i ll ever forgive him for reading me

that crap out loud i wouldn t ve read it out loud to him if he d written it i really wouldn t

in the first place i d only written that damn note so that he wouldn t feel too bad about

flunking me

do you blame me for flunking you boy he said

no sir i certainly don t i said i wished to hell he d stop calling me boy all

the time

he tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it only

he missed again naturally i had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the

atlantic monthly it s boring to do that every two minutes

what would you have done in my place he said tell the truth boy

well you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me so i shot the

bull for a while i told him i was a real moron and all that stuff i told him how i

would ve done exactly the same thing if i d been in his place and how most people didn t

appreciate how tough it is being a teacher that kind of stuff the old bull

the funny thing is though i was sort of thinking of something else while i shot

the bull i live in new york and i was thinking about the lagoon in central park down

near central park south i was wondering if it would be frozen over when i got home

and if it was where did the ducks go i was wondering where the ducks went when the

lagoon got all icy and frozen over i wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them

away to a zoo or something or if they just flew away

i m lucky though i mean i could shoot the old bull to old spencer and think

about those ducks at the same time it s funny you don t have to think too hard when you

talk to a teacher all of a sudden though he interrupted me while i was shooting the bull

he was always interrupting you

how do you feel about all this boy i d be very interested to know very

interested

you mean about my flunking out of pencey and all i said i sort of wished he d

cover up his bumpy chest it wasn t such a beautiful view

if i m not mistaken i believe you also had some difficulty at the whooton

school and at elkton hills he didn t say it just sarcastic but sort of nasty too

i didn t have too much difficulty at elkton hills i told him i didn t exactly

flunk out or anything i just quit sort of

why may i ask

why oh well it s a long story sir i mean it s pretty complicated i didn t feel

like going into the whole thing with him he wouldn t have understood it anyway it

wasn t up his alley at all one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was

surrounded by phonies that s all they were coming in the goddam window for

instance they had this headmaster mr haas that was the phoniest bastard i ever met in

my life ten times worse than old thurmer on sundays for instance old haas went

around shaking hands with everybody s parents when they drove up to school he d be

charming as hell and all except if some boy had little old funny looking parents you

should ve seen the way he did with my roommate s parents i mean if a boy s mother was

sort of fat or corny looking or something and if somebody s father was one of those guys

that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black and white shoes then old

hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he d go

talk for maybe a half an hour with somebody else s parents i can t stand that stuff it

drives me crazy it makes me so depressed i go crazy i hated that goddam elkton hills

old spencer asked me something then but i didn t hear him i was thinking about

old haas what sir i said

do you have any particular qualms about leaving pencey

oh i have a few qualms all right sure but not too many not yet anyway i

guess it hasn t really hit me yet it takes things a while to hit me all i m doing right now

is thinking about going home wednesday i m a moron

do you feel absolutely no concern for your future boy

oh i feel some concern for my future all right sure sure i do i thought about

it for a minute but not too much i guess not too much i guess

you will old spencer said you will boy you will when it s too late

i didn t like hearing him say that it made me sound dead or something it was

very depressing i guess i will i said

i d like to put some sense in that head of yours boy i m trying to help you i m

trying to help you if i can

he really was too you could see that but it was just that we were too much on

opposite sides ot the pole that s all i know you are sir i said thanks a lot no

kidding i appreciate it i really do i got up from the bed then boy i couldn t ve sat

there another ten minutes to save my life the thing is though i have to get going now

i have quite a bit of equipment at the gym i have to get to take home with me i really

do he looked up at me and started nodding again with this very serious look on his

face i felt sorry as hell for him all of a sudden but i just couldn t hang around there any

longer the way we were on opposite sides of the pole and the way he kept missing the

bed whenever he chucked something at it and his sad old bathrobe with his chest

showing and that grippy smell of vicks nose drops all over the place look sir don t

worry about me i said i mean it i ll be all right i m just going through a phase right

now everybody goes through phases and all don t they

i don t know boy i don t know

i hate it when somebody answers that way sure sure they do i said i mean

it sir please don t worry about me i sort of put my hand on his shoulder okay i

said

wouldn t you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go mrs spencer would be

i would i really would but the thing is i have to get going i have to go right to

the gym thanks though thanks a lot sir

then we shook hands and all that crap it made me feel sad as hell though

i ll drop you a line sir take care of your grippe now

good by boy

after i shut the door and started back to the living room he yelled something at

me but i couldn t exactly hear him i m pretty sure he yelled good luck at me

i hope to hell not i d never yell good luck at anybody it sounds terrible when

you think about it

3

i m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life it s awful if i m on my way to

the store to buy a magazine even and somebody asks me where i m going i m liable to

say i m going to the opera it s terrible so when i told old spencer i had to go to the gym

and get my equipment and stuff that was a sheer lie i don t even keep my goddam

equipment in the gym

where i lived at pencey i lived in the ossenburger memorial wing of the new

dorms it was only for juniors and seniors i was a junior my roommate was a senior it

was named after this guy ossenburger that went to pencey he made a pot of dough in

the undertaking business after he got out of pencey what he did he started these

undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family

buried for about five bucks apiece you should see old ossenburger he probably just

shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river anyway he gave pencey a pile of

dough and they named our wing alter him the first football game of the year he came

up to school in this big goddam cadillac and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and

give him a locomotive that s a cheer then the next morning in chapel be made a

speech that lasted about ten hours he started off with about fifty corny jokes just to

show us what a regular guy he was very big deal then he started telling us how he was

never ashamed when he was in some kind of trouble or something to get right down his

knees and pray to god he told us we should always pray to god talk to him and all

wherever we were he told us we ought to think of jesus as our buddy and all he said he

talked to jesus all the time even when he was driving his car that killed me i just see

the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking jesus to send him a few more

stiffs the only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it he was telling us all

about what a swell guy he was what a hot shot and all then all of a sudden this guy

sitting in the row in front of me edgar marsalla laid this terrific fart it was a very crude

thing to do in chapel and all but it was also quite amusing old marsalla he damn near

blew the roof off hardly anybody laughed out loud and old ossenburger made out like

he didn t even hear it but old thurmer the headmaster was sitting right next to him on

the rostrum and all and you could tell he heard it boy was he sore he didn t say

anything then but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic

building and he came up and made a speech he said that the boy that had created the

disturbance in chapel wasn t fit to go to pencey we tried to get old marsalla to rip off

another one right while old thurmer was making his speech but be wasn t in the right

mood anyway that s where i lived at pencey old ossenburger memorial wing in the

new dorms

it was pretty nice to get back to my room after i left old spencer because

everybody was down at the game and the heat was on in our room for a change it felt

sort of cosy i took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar and then i put

on this hat that i d bought in new york that morning it was this red hunting hat with one

of those very very long peaks i saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out

of the subway just after i noticed i d lost all the goddam foils it only cost me a buck

the way i wore it i swung the old peak way around to the back very corny i ll admit

but i liked it that way i looked good in it that way then i got this book i was reading

and sat down in my chair there were two chairs in every room i had one and my

roommate ward stradlater had one the arms were in sad shape because everybody

was always sitting on them but they were pretty comfortable chairs

the book i was reading was this book i took out of the library by mistake they

gave me the wrong book and i didn t notice it till i got back to my room they gave me

out of africa by isak dinesen i thought it was going to stink but it didn t it was a very

good book i m quite illiterate but i read a lot my favorite author is my brother d b and

my next favorite is ring lardner my brother gave me a book by ring lardner for my

birthday just before i went to pencey it had these very funny crazy plays in it and then

it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that s

always speeding only he s married the cop so be can t marry her or anything then this

girl gets killed because she s always speeding that story just about killed me what i

like best is a book that s at least funny once in a while i read a lot of classical books like

the return of the native and all and i like them and i read a lot of war books and

mysteries and all but they don t knock me out too much what really knocks me out is a

book that when you re all done reading it you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific

friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it that

doesn t happen much though i wouldn t mind calling this isak dinesen up and ring

lardner except that d b told me he s dead you take that book of human bondage by

somerset maugham though i read it last summer it s a pretty good book and all but i

wouldn t want to call somerset maugham up i don t know he just isn t the kind of guy

i d want to call up that s all i d rather call old thomas hardy up i like that eustacia vye

anyway i put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book out of

africa i d read it already but i wanted to read certain parts over again i d only read

about three pages though when i heard somebody coming through the shower curtains

even without looking up i knew right away who it was it was robert ackley this guy

that roomed right next to me there was a shower right between every two rooms in our

wing and about eighty five times a day old ackley barged in on me he was probably the

only guy in the whole dorm besides me that wasn t down at the game he hardly ever

went anywhere he was a very peculiar guy he was a senior and he d been at pencey the

whole four years and all but nobody ever called him anything except ackley not even

herb gale his own roommate ever called him bob or even ack if he ever gets

married his own wife ll probably call him ackley he was one of these very very tall

round shouldered guys he was about six four with lousy teeth the whole time he

roomed next to me i never even once saw him brush his teeth they always looked

mossy and awful and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room

with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something besides that he had a lot

of pimples not just on his forehead or his chin like most guys but all over his whole

face and not only that he had a terrible personality he was also sort of a nasty guy i

wasn t too crazy about him to tell you the truth

i could feel him standing on the shower ledge right behind my chair taking a

look to see if stradlater was around he hated stradlater s guts and he never came in the

room if stradlater was around he hated everybody s guts damn near

he came down off the shower ledge and came in the room hi he said he

always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired he didn t want you to

think he was visiting you or anything he wanted you to think he d come in by mistake

for god s sake

hi i said but i didn t look up from my book with a guy like ackley if you

looked up from your book you were a goner you were a goner anyway but not as quick

if you didn t look up right away

he started walking around the room very slow and all the way he always did

picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier he always picked up your

personal stuff and looked at it boy could he get on your nerves sometimes how was

the fencing he said he just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself he didn t

give a damn about the fencing we win or what he said

nobody won i said without looking up though

what he said he always made you say everything twice

nobody won i said i sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with

on my chiffonier he was looking at this picture of this girl i used to go around with in

new york sally hayes he must ve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at

least five thousand times since i got it he always put it back in the wrong place too

when he was finished he did it on purpose you could tell

nobody won he said how come

i left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway i still didn t look up at him

on the subway for chrissake ya lost them ya mean

we got on the wrong subway i had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map

on the wall

he came over and stood right in my light hey i said i ve read this same

sentence about twenty times since you came in

i don t know and i don t give a damn how bout sitting down or something

ackley kid you re right in my goddam light he didn t like it when you called him

ackley kid he was always telling me i was a goddam kid because i was sixteen and

he was eighteen it drove him mad when i called him ackley kid

he kept standing there he was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn t get out of

your light when you asked him to he d do it finally but it took him a lot longer if you

asked him to what the hellya reading he said

goddam book

he shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it any

good he said

this sentence i m reading is terrific i can be quite sarcastic when i m in the

mood he didn t get it though he started walking around the room again picking up all

my personal stuff and stradlater s finally i put my book down on the floor you

couldn t read anything with a guy like ackley around it was impossible

i slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old ackley making himself at

home i was feeling sort of tired from the trip to new york and all and i started yawning

then i started horsing around a little bit sometimes i horse around quite a lot just to

keep from getting bored what i did was i pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around

to the front then pulled it way down over my eyes that way i couldn t see a goddam

thing i think i m going blind i said in this very hoarse voice mother darling

everything s getting so dark in here

you re nuts i swear to god ackley said

mother darling give me your hand why won t you give me your hand

for chrissake grow up

i started groping around in front of me like a blind guy but without getting up or

anything i kept saying mother darling why won t you give me your hand i was only

horsing around naturally that stuff gives me a bang sometimes besides i know it

annoyed hell out of old ackley he always brought out the old sadist in me i was pretty

sadistic with him quite often finally i quit though i pulled the peak around to the back

again and relaxed

who belongsa this ackley said he was holding my roommate s knee

supporter up to show me that guy ackley d pick up anything he d even pick up your

jock strap or something i told him it was stradlater s so he chucked it on stradlater s

bed he got it off stradlater s chiffonier so he chucked it on the bed

he came over and sat down on the arm of stradlater s chair he never sat down in

a chair just always on the arm where the hellja get that hat he said

new york

how much

a buck

you got robbed he started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a

match he was always cleaning his fingernails it was funny in a way his teeth were

always mossy looking and his ears were always dirty as hell but he was always cleaning

his fingernails i guess he thought that made him a very neat guy he took another look at

my hat while he was cleaning them up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in

for chrissake he said that s a deer shooting hat

like hell it is i took it off and looked at it i sort of closed one eye like i was

taking aim at it this is a people shooting hat i said i shoot people in this hat

your folks know you got kicked out yet

nope

where the hell s stradlater at anyway

down at the game he s got a date i yawned i was yawning all over the place

for one thing the room was too damn hot it made you sleepy at pencey you either

froze to death or died of the heat

the great stradlater ackley said hey lend me your scissors a second

willya ya got em handy

no i packed them already they re way in the top of the closet

get em a second willya ackley said i got this hangnail i want to cut off

he didn t care if you d packed something or not and had it way in the top of the

closet i got them for him though i nearly got killed doing it too the second i opened

the closet door stradlater s tennis racket in its wooden press and all fell right on my

head it made a big clunk and it hurt like hell it damn near killed old ackley though he

started laughing in this very high falsetto voice he kept laughing the whole time i was

taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him something like that a guy

getting hit on the head with a rock or something tickled the pants off ackley you have

a damn good sense of humor ackley kid i told him you know that i handed him the

scissors lemme be your manager i ll get you on the goddam radio i sat down in my

chair again and he started cutting his big horny looking nails how bout using the table

or something i said cut em over the table willya i don t feel like walking on your

crumby nails in my bare feet tonight he kept right on cutting them over the floor

though what lousy manners i mean it

who s stradlater s date he said he was always keeping tabs on who stradlater

was dating even though he hated stradlater s guts

i don t know why

no reason boy i can t stand that sonuvabitch he s one sonuvabitch i really can t

stand

he s crazy about you he told me he thinks you re a goddam prince i said i call

people a prince quite often when i m horsing around it keeps me from getting bored or

something

he s got this superior attitude all the time ackley said i just can t stand the

sonuvabitch you d think he

do you mind cutting your nails over the table hey i said i ve asked you about

fifty

he s got this goddam superior attitude all the time ackley said i don t even

think the sonuvabitch is intelligent he thinks he is he thinks he s about the most

ackley for chrissake willya please cut your crumby nails over the table i ve

asked you fifty times

he started cutting his nails over the table for a change the only way he ever did

anything was if you yelled at him

i watched him for a while then i said the reason you re sore at stradlater is

because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while he didn t mean to

insult you for cryin out loud he didn t say it right or anything but he didn t mean

anything insulting all he meant was you d look better and feel better if you sort of

brushed your teeth once in a while

i brush my teeth don t gimme that

no you don t i ve seen you and you don t i said i didn t say it nasty though i

felt sort of sorry for him in a way i mean it isn t too nice naturally if somebody tells

you you don t brush your teeth stradlater s all right he s not too bad i said you don t

know him thats the trouble

i still say he s a sonuvabitch he s a conceited sonuvabitch

he s conceited but he s very generous in some things he really is i said

look suppose for instance stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked

say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot i m just giving you an example now

you know what he d do he d probably take it off and give it ta you he really would

or you know what he d do he d leave it on your bed or something but he d give you

the goddam tie most guys would probably just

hell ackley said if i had his dough i would too

no you wouldn t i shook my head no you wouldn t ackley kid if you had

his dough you d be one of the biggest

stop calling me ackley kid god damn it i m old enough to be your lousy

father

no you re not boy he could really be aggravating sometimes he never missed

a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen in the first place i

wouldn t let you in my goddam family i said

well just cut out calling me

all of a sudden the door opened and old stradlater barged in in a big hurry he

was always in a big hurry everything was a very big deal he came over to me and gave

me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks which is something that can be very

annoying listen he said you going out anywheres special tonight

i don t know i might what the hell s it doing out snowing he had snow all

over his coat

yeah listen if you re not going out anyplace special how bout lending me

your hound s tooth jacket

who won the game i said

it s only the half we re leaving stradlater said no kidding you gonna use

your hound s tooth tonight or not i spilled some crap all over my gray flannel

no but i don t want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all i

said we were practically the same heighth but he weighed about twice as much as i did

he had these very broad shoulders

i won t stretch it he went over to the closet in a big hurry how sa boy

ackley he said to ackley he was at least a pretty friendly guy stradlater it was partly

a phony kind of friendly but at least he always said hello to ackley and all

ackley just sort of grunted when he said how sa boy he wouldn t answer him

but he didn t have guts enough not to at least grunt then he said to me i think i ll get

going see ya later

okay i said he never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own

room

old stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all i think maybe i ll take a

fast shave he said he had a pretty heavy beard he really did

where s your date i asked him

she s waiting in the annex he went out of the room with his toilet kit and

towel under his arm no shirt on or anything he always walked around in his bare torso

because he thought he had a damn good build he did too i have to admit it

4

i didn t have anything special to do so i went down to the can and chewed the rag

with him while he was shaving we were the only ones in the can because everybody

was still down at the game it was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy there

were about ten washbowls all right against the wall stradlater had the middle one i sat

down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off this

nervous habit i have stradlater kept whistling song of india while he shaved he had

one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune and he always

picked out some song that s hard to whistle even if you re a good whistler like song of

india or slaughter on tenth avenue he could really mess a song up

you remember i said before that ackley was a slob in his personal habits well

so was stradlater but in a different way stradlater was more of a secret slob he always

looked all right stradlater but for instance you should ve seen the razor he shaved

himself with it was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap he never

cleaned it or anything he always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up

but he was a secret slob anyway if you knew him the way i did the reason he fixed

himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself he thought he

was the handsomest guy in the western hemisphere he was pretty handsome too i ll

admit it but he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his

picture in your year book they d right away say who s this boy i mean he was

mostly a year book kind of handsome guy i knew a lot of guys at pencey i thought were

a lot handsomer than stradlater but they wouldn t look handsome if you saw their

pictures in the year book they d look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out i ve

had that experience frequently

anyway i was sitting on the washbowl next to where stradlater was shaving sort

of turning the water on and off i still had my red hunting hat on with the peak around to

the back and all i really got a bang out of that hat

hey stradlater said wanna do me a big favor

what i said not too enthusiastic he was always asking you to do him a big

favor you take a very handsome guy or a guy that thinks he s a real hot shot and they re

always asking you to do them a big favor just because they re crazy about themseif they

think you re crazy about them too and that you re just dying to do them a favor it s sort

of funny in a way

you goin out tonight he said

i might i might not i don t know why

i got about a hundred pages to read for history for monday he said how bout

writing a composition for me for english i ll be up the creek if i don t get the goddam

thing in by monday the reason i ask how bout it

it was very ironical it really was

i m the one that s flunking out of the goddam place and you re asking me to

write you a goddam composition i said

yeah i know the thing is though i ll be up the creek if i don t get it in be a

buddy be a buddyroo okay

i didn t answer him right away suspense is good for some bastards like

stradlater

what on i said

anything anything descriptive a room or a house or something you once

lived in or something you know just as long as it s descriptive as hell he gave out a

big yawn while he said that which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass i

mean if somebody yawns right while they re asking you to do them a goddam favor just

don t do it too good is all he said that sonuvabitch hartzell thinks you re a hot shot in

english and he knows you re my roommate so i mean don t stick all the commas and

stuff in the right place

that s something else that gives me a royal pain i mean if you re good at writing

compositions and somebody starts talking about commas stradlater was always doing

that he wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions

was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place he was a little bit like ackley

that way i once sat next to ackley at this basketball game we had a terrific guy on the

team howie coyle that could sink them from the middle of the floor without even

touching the backboard or anything ackley kept saying the whole goddam game that

coyle had a perfect build for basketball god how i hate that stuff

i got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while so i backed up a few feet and

started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it i was just amusing myself i can t really

tap dance or anything but it was a stone floor in the can and it was good for tap dancing

i started imitating one of those guys in the movies in one of those musicals i hate the

movies like poison but i get a bang imitating them old stradlater watched me in the

mirror while he was shaving all i need s an audience i m an exhibitionist i m the

goddarn governor s son i said i was knocking myself out tap dancing all over the

place he doesn t want me to be a tap dancer he wants me to go to oxford but it s in

my goddam blood tap dancing old stradlater laughed he didn t have too bad a sense

of humor it s the opening night of the ziegfeld follies i was getting out of breath i

have hardly any wind at all the leading man can t go on he s drunk as a bastard so

who do they get to take his place me that s who the little ole goddam governor s son

where dja get that hat stradlater said he meant my hunting hat he d never

seen it before

i was out of breath anyway so i quit horsing around i took off my hat and looked

at it for about the ninetieth time i got it in new york this morning for a buck ya like

it

stradlater nodded sharp he said he was only flattering me though because

right away he said listen are ya gonna write that composition for me i have to

know

if i get the time i will if i don t i won t i said i went over and sat down at the

washbowl next to him again who s your date i asked him fitzgerald

hell no i told ya i m through with that pig

yeah give her to me boy no kidding she s my type

take her she s too old for you

all of a sudden for no good reason really except that i was sort of in the mood

for horsing around i felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old stradlater in a

half nelson that s a wrestling hold in case you don t know where you get the other guy

around the neck and choke him to death if you feel like it so i did it i landed on him

like a goddam panther

cut it out holden for chrissake stradlater said he didn t feel like horsing

around he was shaving and all wuddaya wanna make me do cut my goddam head

off

i didn t let go though i had a pretty good half nelson on him liberate yourself

from my viselike grip i said

je sus christ he put down his razor and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and

sort of broke my hold on him he was a very strong guy i m a very weak guy now cut

out the crap he said he started shaving himself all over again he always shaved

himself twice to look gorgeous with his crumby old razor

who is your date if it isn t fitzgerald i asked him i sat down on the washbowl

next to him again that phyllis smith babe

no it was supposed to he but the arrangements got all screwed up i got bud

thaw s girl s roommate now hey i almost forgot she knows you

who does i said

my date

yeah i said what s her name i was pretty interested

i m thinking uh jean gallagher

boy i nearly dropped dead when he said that

jane gallagher i said i even got up from the washbowl when he said that i

damn near dropped dead you re damn right i know her she practically lived right next

door to me the summer before last she had this big damn doberman pinscher that s

how i met her her dog used to keep coming over in our

you re right in my light holden for chrissake stradlater said ya have to

stand right there

boy was i excited though i really was

where is she i asked him i oughta go down and say hello to her or

something where is she in the annex

yeah

how d she happen to mention me does she go to b m now she said she might

go there she said she might go to shipley too i thought she went to shipley how d she

happen to mention me i was pretty excited i really was

i don t know for chrissake lift up willya you re on my towel stradlater

said i was sitting on his stupid towel

jane gallagher i said i couldn t get over it jesus h christ

old stradlater was putting vitalis on his hair my vitalis

she s a dancer i said ballet and all she used to practice about two hours

every day right in the middle of the hottest weather and all she was worried that it might

make her legs lousy all thick and all i used to play checkers with her all the time

you used to play what with her all the time

checkers

checkers for chrissake

yeah she wouldn t move any of her kings what she d do when she d get a king

she wouldn t move it she d just leave it in the back row she d get them all lined up in the

back row then she d never use them she just liked the way they looked when they were

all in the back row

stradlater didn t say anything that kind of stuff doesn t interest most people

her mother belonged to the same club we did i said i used to caddy once in a

while just to make some dough i caddy d for her mother a couple of times she went

around in about a hundred and seventy for nine holes

stradlater wasn t hardly listening he was combing his gorgeous locks

i oughta go down and at least say hello to her i said

why don tcha

i will in a minute

he started parting his hair all over again it took him about an hour to comb his

hair

her mother and father were divorced her mother was married again to some

booze hound i said skinny guy with hairy legs i remember him he wore shorts all

the time jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing but all i

ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery

program on the radio and run around the goddam house naked with jane around and

all

yeah stradlater said that really interested him about the booze hound

running around the house naked with jane around stradlater was a very sexy bastard

she had a lousy childhood i m not kidding

that didn t interest stradlater though only very sexy stuff interested him

jane gallagher jesus i couldn t get her off my mind i really couldn t i

oughta go down and say hello to her at least

why the hell don tcha instead of keep saying it stradlater said

i walked over to the window but you couldn t see out of it it was so steamy from

all the heat in the can i m not in the mood right now i said i wasn t either you have

to be in the mood for those things i thought she went to shipley i could ve sworn she

went to shipley i walked around the can for a little while i didn t have anything else to

do did she enjoy the game i said

yeah i guess so i don t know

did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time or anything

i don t know for chrissake i only just met her stradlater said he was finished

combing his goddam gorgeous hair he was putting away all his crumby toilet articles

listen give her my regards willya

okay stradlater said but i knew he probably wouldn t you take a guy like

stradlater they never give your regards to people

he went back to the room but i stuck around in the can for a while thinking

about old jane then i went back to the room too

stradlater was putting on his tie in front of the mirror when i got there he spent

around half his goddam life in front of the mirror i sat down in my chair and sort of

watched him for a while

hey i said don t tell her i got kicked out willya

okay

that was one good thing about stradlater you didn t have to explain every

goddam little thing with him the way you had to do with ackley mostly i guess

because he wasn t too interested that s really why ackley it was different ackley was

a very nosy bastard

he put on my hound s tooth jacket

jesus now try not to stretch it all over the place i said i d only worn it about

twice

i won t where the hell s my cigarettes

on the desk he never knew where he left anything under your muffler he

put them in his coat pocket my coat pocket

i pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden for a

change i was getting sort of nervous all of a sudden i m quite a nervous guy listen

where ya going on your date with her i asked him ya know yet

i don t know new york if we have time she only signed out for nine thirty for

chrissake

i didn t like the way he said it so i said the reason she did that she probably

just didn t know what a handsome charming bastard you are if she d known she

probably would ve signed out for nine thirty in the morning

goddam right stradlater said you couldn t rile him too easily he was too

conceited no kidding now do that composition for me he said he had his coat on

and he was all ready to go don t knock yourself out or anything but just make it

descriptive as hell okay

i didn t answer him i didn t feel like it all i said was ask her if she still keeps

all her kings in the back row

okay stradlater said but i knew he wouldn t take it easy now he banged

the hell out of the room

i sat there for about a half hour after he left i mean i just sat in my chair not

doing anything i kept thinking about jane and about stradlater having a date with her

and all it made me so nervous i nearly went crazy i already told you what a sexy bastard

stradlater was

all of a sudden ackley barged back in again through the damn shower curtains

as usual for once in my stupid life i was really glad to see him he took my mind off the

other stuff

he stuck around till around dinnertime talking about all the guys at pencey that

he hated their guts and squeezing this big pimple on his chin he didn t even use his

handkerchief i don t even think the bastard had a handkerchief if you want to know the

truth i never saw him use one anyway

5

we always had the same meal on saturday nights at pencey it was supposed to

be a big deal because they gave you steak i ll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did

that was because a lot of guys parents came up to school on sunday and old thurmer

probably figured everybody s mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner

last night and he d say steak what a racket you should ve seen the steaks they were

these little hard dry jobs that you could hardly even cut you always got these very

lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night and for dessert you got brown betty which

nobody ate except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didn t know any better

and guys like ackley that ate everything

it was nice though when we got out of the dining room there were about three

inches of snow on the ground and it was still coming down like a madman it looked

pretty as hell and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the

place it was very childish but everybody was really enjoying themselves

i didn t have a date or anything so i and this friend of mine mal brossard that

was on the wrestling team decided we d take a bus into agerstown and have a hamburger

and maybe see a lousy movie neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night i

asked mal if he minded if ackley came along with us the reason i asked was because

ackley never did anything on saturday night except stay in his room and squeeze his

pimples or something mal said he didn t mind but that he wasn t too crazy about the idea

he didn t like ackley much anyway we both went to our rooms to get ready and all

and while i was putting on my galoshes and crap i yelled over and asked old ackley if

he wanted to go to the movies he could hear me all right through the shower curtains

but he didn t answer me right away he was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you

right away finally he came over through the goddam curtains and stood on the shower

ledge and asked who was going besides me he always had to know who was going i

swear if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere and you rescued him in a goddam boat

he d want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he d even get in i told him

mal brossard was going he said that bastard all right wait a second you d

think he was doing you a big favor

it took him about five hours to get ready while he was doing it i went over to

my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands the snow was

very good for packing i didn t throw it at anything though i started to throw it at a car

that was parked across the street but i changed my mind the car looked so nice and

white then i started to throw it at a hydrant but that looked too nice and white too

finally i didn t throw it at anything all i did was close the window and walk around the

room with the snowball packing it harder a little while later i still had it with me when

i and brossnad and ackley got on the bus the bus driver opened the doors and made me

throw it out i told him i wasn t going to chuck it at anybody but he wouldn t believe me

people never believe you

brossard and ackley both had seen the picture that was playing so all we did we

just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while then

took the bus back to pencey i didn t care about not seeing the movie anyway it was

supposed to be a comedy with cary grant in it and all that crap besides i d been to the

movies with brossard and ackley before they both laughed like hyenas at stuff that

wasn t even funny i didn t even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies

it was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm old brossard

was a bridge fiend and he started looking around the dorm for a game old ackley

parked himself in my room just for a change only instead of sitting on the arm of

stradlater s chair he laid down on my bed with his face right on my pillow and all he

started talking in this very monotonous voice and picking at all his pimples i dropped

about a thousand hints but i couldn t get rid of him all he did was keep talking in this

very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse

with the summer before he d already told me about it about a hundred times every time

he told it it was different one minute he d be giving it to her in his cousin s buick the

next minute he d be giving it to her under some boardwalk it was all a lot of crap

naturally he was a virgin if ever i saw one i doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel

anyway finally i had to come right out and tell him that i had to write a composition for

stradlater and that he had to clear the hell out so i could concentrate he finally did but

he took his time about it as usual after he left i put on my pajamas and bathrobe and

my old hunting hat and started writing the composition

the thing was i couldn t think of a room or a house or anything to describe the

way stradlater said he had to have i m not too crazy about describing rooms and houses

anyway so what i did i wrote about my brother allie s baseball mitt it was a very

descriptive subject it really was my brother allie had this left handed fielder s mitt he

was left handed the thing that was descriptive about it though was that he had poems

written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere in green ink he wrote them

on it so that he d have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at

bat he s dead now he got leukemia and died when we were up in maine on july 18

1946 you d have liked him he was two years younger than i was but he was about fifty

times as intelligent he was terrifically intelligent his teachers were always writing

letters to my mother telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like allie in their

class and they weren t just shooting the crap they really meant it but it wasn t just that

he was the most intelligent member in the family he was also the nicest in lots of ways

he never got mad at anybody people with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily

but allie never did and he had very red hair i ll tell you what kind of red hair he had i

started playing golf when i was only ten years old i remember once the summer i was

around twelve teeing off and all and having a hunch that if i turned around all of a

sudden i d see allie so i did and sure enough he was sitting on his bike outside the

fence there was this fence that went all around the course and he was sitting there

about a hundred and fifty yards behind me watching me tee off that s the kind of red

hair he had god he was a nice kid though he used to laugh so hard at something he

thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair i was only thirteen and

they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all because i broke all the windows in

the garage i don t blame them i really don t i slept in the garage the night he died and i

broke all the goddam windows with my fist just for the hell of it i even tried to break all

the windows on the station wagon we had that summer but my hand was already broken

and everything by that time and i couldn t do it it was a very stupid thing to do i ll

admit but i hardly didn t even know i was doing it and you didn t know allie my hand

still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all and i can t make a real fist any more

not a tight one i mean but outside of that i don t care much i mean i m not going to be a

goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway

anyway that s what i wrote stradlater s composition about old allie s baseball

mitt i happened to have it with me in my suitcase so i got it out and copied down the

poems that were written on it all i had to do was change allie s name so that nobody

would know it was my brother and not stradlater s i wasn t too crazy about doing it but i

couldn t think of anything else descriptive besides i sort of liked writing about it it took

me about an hour because i had to use stradlater s lousy typewriter and it kept jamming

on me the reason i didn t use my own was because i d lent it to a guy down the hall

it was around ten thirty i guess when i finished it i wasn t tired though so i

looked out the window for a while it wasn t snowing out any more but every once in a

while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started you could also hear

old ackley snoring right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him he

had sinus trouble and he couldn t breathe too hot when he was asleep that guy had just

about everything sinus trouble pimples lousy teeth halitosis crumby fingernails you

had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch

some things are hard to remember i m thinking now of when stradlater got back

from his date with jane i mean i can t remember exactly what i was doing when i heard

his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor i probably was still looking out

the window but i swear i can t remember i was so damn worried that s why when i

really worry about something i don t just fool around i even have to go to the bathroom

when i worry about something only i don t go i m too worried to go i don t want to

interrupt my worrying to go if you knew stradlater you d have been worried too i d

double dated with that bastard a couple of times and i know what i m talking about he

was unscrupulous he really was

anyway the corridor was all linoleum and all and you could hear his goddam

footsteps coming right towards the room i don t even remember where i was sitting when

he came in at the window or in my chair or his i swear i can t remember

he came in griping about how cold it was out then he said where the hell is

everybody it s like a goddam morgue around here i didn t even bother to answer him

if he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was saturday night and everybody was out or

asleep or home for the week end i wasn t going to break my neck telling him he started

getting undressed he didn t say one goddam word about jane not one neither did i i

just watched him all he did was thank me for letting him wear my hound s tooth he

hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet

then when he was taking off his tie he asked me if i d written his goddam

composition for him i told him it was over on his goddam bed he walked over and read

it while he was unbuttoning his shirt he stood there reading it and sort of stroking his

bare chest and stomach with this very stupid expression on his face he was always

stroking his stomach or his chest he was mad about himself

all of a sudden he said for chrissake holden this is about a goddam baseball

glove

so what i said cold as hell

wuddaya mean so what i told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house

or something

you said it had to be descriptive what the hell s the difference if it s about a

baseball glove

god damn it he was sore as hell he was really furious you always do

everything backasswards he looked at me no wonder you re flunking the hell out of

here he said you don t do one damn thing the way you re supposed to i mean it not

one damn thing

all right give it back to me then i said i went over and pulled it right out of

his goddam hand then i tore it up

what the hellja do that for he said

i didn t even answer him i just threw the pieces in the wastebasket then i lay

down on my bed and we both didn t say anything for a long time he got all undressed

down to his shorts and i lay on my bed and lit a cigarette you weren t allowed to smoke

in the dorm but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and

nobody could smell the smoke besides i did it to annoy stradlater it drove him crazy

when you broke any rules he never smoked in the dorm it was only me

he still didn t say one single solitary word about jane so finally i said you re

back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine thirty did you make her be late

signing in

he was sitting on the edge of his bed cutting his goddam toenails when i asked

him that coupla minutes he said who the hell signs out for nine thirty on a saturday

night god how i hated him

did you go to new york i said

ya crazy how the hell could we go to new york if she only signed out for

nine thirty

that s tough

he looked up at me listen he said if you re gonna smoke in the room how

bout going down to the can and do it you may be getting the hell out of here but i have

to stick around long enough to graduate

i ignored him i really did i went right on smoking like a madman all i did was

sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails what a school you

were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or

something

did you give her my regards i asked him

yeah

the hell he did the bastard

what d she say i said did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the

back row

no i didn t ask her what the hell ya think we did all night play checkers for

chrissake

i didn t even answer him god how i hated him

if you didn t go to new york where d ya go with her i asked him after a little

while i could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place boy was i getting

nervous i just had a feeling something had gone funny

he was finished cutting his damn toenails so he got up from the bed in just his

damn shorts and all and started getting very damn playful he came over to my bed and

started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder cut it

out i said where d you go with her if you didn t go to new york

nowhere we just sat in the goddam car he gave me another one of those

playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder

cut it out i said whose car

ed banky s

ed banky was the basketball coach at pencey old stradlater was one of his pets

because he was the center on the team and ed banky always let him borrow his car when

he wanted it it wasn t allowed for students to borrow faculty guys cars but all the

athletic bastards stuck together in every school i ve gone to all the athletic bastards stick

together

stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder he had his

toothbrush in his hand and he put it in his mouth what d you do i said give her the

time in ed banky s goddam car my voice was shaking something awful

what a thing to say want me to wash your mouth out with soap

did you

that s a professional secret buddy

this next part i don t remember so hot all i know is i got up from the bed like i

was going down to the can or something and then i tried to sock him with all my might

right smack in the toothbrush so it would split his goddam throat open only i missed i

didn t connect all i did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something it

probably hurt him a little bit but not as much as i wanted it probably would ve hurt him

a lot but i did it with my right hand and i can t make a good fist with that hand on

account of that injury i told you about

anyway the next thing i knew i was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on

my chest with his face all red that is he had his goddam knees on my chest and he

weighed about a ton he had hold of my wrists too so i couldn t take another sock at

him i d ve killed him

what the hell s the matter with you he kept saying and his stupid race kept

getting redder and redder

get your lousy knees off my chest i told him i was almost bawling i really

was go on get off a me ya crumby bastard

he wouldn t do it though he kept holding onto my wrists and i kept calling him

a sonuvabitch and all for around ten hours i can hardly even remember what all i said to

him i told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like i told him he

didn t even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not and the reason he didn t

care was because he was a goddam stupid moron he hated it when you called a moron

all morons hate it when you call them a moron

shut up now holden he said with his big stupid red face just shut up now

you don t even know if her first name is jane or jean ya goddam moron

now shut up holden god damn it i m warning ya he said i really had him

going if you don t shut up i m gonna slam ya one

get your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest

if i letcha up will you keep your mouth shut

i didn t even answer him

he said it over again holden if i letcha up willya keep your mouth shut

yes

he got up off me and i got up too my chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees

you re a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron i told him

that got him really mad he shook his big stupid finger in my face holden god

damn it i m warning you now for the last time if you don t keep your yap shut i m

gonna

why should i i said i was practically yelling that s just the trouble with all

you morons you never want to discuss anything that s the way you can always tell a

moron they never want to discuss anything intellig

then he really let one go at me and the next thing i knew i was on the goddam

floor again i don t remember if he knocked me out or not but i don t think so it s pretty

hard to knock a guy out except in the goddam movies but my nose was bleeding all

over the place when i looked up old stradlater was standing practically right on top of

me he had his goddam toilet kit under his arm why the hell don tcha shut up when i

tellya to he said he sounded pretty nervous he probably was scared he d fractured my

skull or something when i hit the floor it s too bad i didn t you asked for it god damn

it he said boy did he look worried

i didn t even bother to get up i just lay there in the floor for a while and kept

calling him a moron sonuvabitch i was so mad i was practically bawling

listen go wash your face stradlater said ya hear me

i told him to go wash his own moron face which was a pretty childish thing to

say but i was mad as hell i told him to stop off on the way to the can and give mrs

schmidt the time mrs schmidt was the janitor s wife she was around sixty five

i kept sitting there on the floor till i heard old stradlater close the door and go

down the corridor to the can then i got up i couldn t find my goddam hunting hat

anywhere finally i found it it was under the bed i put it on and turned the old peak

around to the back the way i liked it and then i went over and took a look at my stupid

face in the mirror you never saw such gore in your life i had blood all over my mouth

and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe it partly scared me and it partly

fascinated me all that blood and all sort of made me look tough i d only been in about

two fights in my life and i lost both of them i m not too tough i m a pacifist if you want

to know the truth

i had a feeling old ackley d probably heard all the racket and was awake so i

went through the shower curtains into his room just to see what the hell he was doing i

hardly ever went over to his room it always had a funny stink in it because he was so

crumby in his personal habits

7

a tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room and i

could see him lying in bed i knew damn well he was wide awake ackley i said

y awake

yeah

it was pretty dark and i stepped on somebody s shoe on the floor and danm near

fell on my head ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm he had a lot of white

stuff on his face for his pimples he looked sort of spooky in the dark what the hellya

doing anyway i said

wuddaya mean what the hell am i doing i was tryna sleep before you guys

started making all that noise what the hell was the fight about anyhow

where s the light i couldn t find the light i was sliding my hand all over the

wall

wuddaya want the light for right next to your hand

i finally found the switch and turned it on old ackley put his hand up so the light

wouldn t hurt his eyes

jesus he said what the hell happened to you he meant all the blood and all

i had a little goddam tiff with stradlater i said then i sat down on the floor

they never had any chairs in their room i don t know what the hell they did with their

chairs listen i said do you feel like playing a little canasta he was a canasta

fiend

you re still bleeding for chrissake you better put something on it

it ll stop listen ya wanna play a little canasta or don tcha

canasta for chrissake do you know what time it is by any chance

it isn t late it s only around eleven eleven thirty

only around ackley said listen i gotta get up and go to mass in the

morning for chrissake you guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the

goddam what the hell was the fight about anyhow

it s a long story i don t wanna bore ya ackley i m thinking of your welfare i

told him i never discussed my personal life with him in the first place he was even

more stupid than stradlater stradlater was a goddam genius next to ackley hey i

said is it okay if i sleep in ely s bed tonight he won t be back till tomorrow night will

he i knew damn well he wouldn t ely went home damn near every week end

i don t know when the hell he s coming back ackley said

boy did that annoy me what the hell do you mean you don t know when he s

coming back he never comes back till sunday night does he

no but for chrissake i can t just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam

bed if they want to

that killed me i reached up from where i was sitting on the floor and patted him

on the goddam shoulder you re a prince ackley kid i said you know that

no i mean it i can t just tell somebody they can sleep in

you re a real prince you re a gentleman and a scholar kid i said he really

was too do you happen to have any cigarettes by any chance say no or i ll drop

dead

no i don t as a matter of fact listen what the hell was the fight about

i didn t answer him all i did was i got up and went over and looked out the

window i felt so lonesome all of a sudden i almost wished i was dead

what the hell was the fight about anyhow ackley said for about the fiftieth

time he certainly was a bore about that

about you i said

about me for chrissake

yeah i was defending your goddam honor stradlater said you had a lousy

personality i couldn t let him get away with that stuff

that got him excited he did no kidding he did

i told him i was only kidding and then i went over and laid down on ely s bed

boy did i feel rotten i felt so damn lonesome

this room stinks i said i can smell your socks from way over here don tcha

ever send them to the laundry

if you don t like it you know what you can do ackley said what a witty guy

how bout turning off the goddam light

i didn t turn it off right away though i just kept laying there on ely s bed

thinking about jane and all it just drove me stark staring mad when i thought about her

and stradlater parked somewhere in that fat assed ed banky s car every time i thought

about it i felt like jumping out the window the thing is you didn t know stradlater i

knew him most guys at pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all

the time like ackley for instance but old stradlater really did it i was personally

acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to that s the truth

tell me the story of your fascinating life ackley kid i said

how bout turning off the goddam light i gotta get up for mass in the morning

i got up and turned it off if it made him happy then i laid down on ely s bed

again

what re ya gonna do sleep in ely s bed ackley said he was the perfect host

boy

i may i may not don t worry about it

i m not worried about it only i d hate like hell if ely came in all of a sudden and

found some guy

relax i m not gonna sleep here i wouldn t abuse your goddam hospitality

a couple of minutes later he was snoring like mad i kept laying there in the dark

anyway though trying not to think about old jane and stradlater in that goddam ed

banky s car but it was almost impossible the trouble was i knew that guy stradlater s

technique that made it even worse we once double dated in ed banky s car and

stradlater was in the back with his date and i was in the front with mine what a

technique that guy had what he d do was he d start snowing his date in this very quiet

sincere voice like as if he wasn t only a very handsome guy but a nice sincere guy too i

damn near puked listening to him his date kept saying no please please don t

please but old stradlater kept snowing her in this abraham lincoln sincere voice and

finally there d be this terrific silence in the back of the car it was really embarrassing i

don t think he gave that girl the time that night but damn near damn near

while i was laying there trying not to think i heard old stradlater come back

from the can and go in our room you could hear him putting away his crumby toilet

articles and all and opening the window he was a fresh air fiend then a little while

later he turned off the light he didn t even look around to see where i was at

it was even depressing out in the street you couldn t even hear any cars any

more i got feeling so lonesome and rotten i even felt like waking ackley up

hey ackley i said in sort of a whisper so stradlater couldn t hear me through

the shower curtain

ackley didn t hear me though

hey ackley

he still didn t hear me he slept like a rock

hey ackley

he heard that all right

what the hell s the matter with you he said i was asleep for chrissake

listen what s the routine on joining a monastery i asked him i was sort of

toying with the idea of joining one do you have to be a catholic and all

certainly you have to be a catholic you bastard did you wake me just to ask

me a dumb ques

aah go back to sleep i m not gonna join one anyway the kind of luck i have

i d probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it all stupid bastards or just

bastards

when i said that old ackley sat way the hell up in bed listen he said i don t

care what you say about me or anything but if you start making cracks about my goddam

religion for chrissake

relax i said nobody s making any cracks about your goddam religion i got

up off ely s bed and started towards the door i didn t want to hang around in that stupid

atmosphere any more i stopped on the way though and picked up ackley s hand and

gave him a big phony handshake he pulled it away from me what s the idea he said

no idea i just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince that s all i

said i said it in this very sincere voice you re aces ackley kid i said you know

that

wise guy someday somebody s gonna bash your

i didn t even bother to listen to him i shut the damn door and went out in the

corridor

everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end and it was very very

quiet and depressing in the corridor there was this empty box of kolynos toothpaste

outside leahy and hoffman s door and while i walked down towards the stairs i kept

giving it a boot with this sheep lined slipper i had on what i thought i d do i thought i

might go down and see what old mal brossard was doing but all of a sudden i changed

my mind all of a sudden i decided what i d really do i d get the hell out of pencey

right that same night and all i mean not wait till wednesday or anything i just didn t

want to hang around any more it made me too sad and lonesome so what i decided to

do i decided i d take a room in a hotel in new york some very inexpensive hotel and

all and just take it easy till wednesday then on wednesday i d go home all rested up

and feeling swell i figured my parents probably wouldn t get old thurmer s letter saying

i d been given the ax till maybe tuesday or wednesday i didn t want to go home or

anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all i didn t want to be around

when they first got it my mother gets very hysterical she s not too bad after she gets

something thoroughly digested though besides i sort of needed a little vacation my

nerves were shot they really were

anyway that s what i decided i d do so i went back to the room and turned on

the light to start packing and all i already had quite a few things packed old stradlater

didn t even wake up i lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then i packed these two

gladstones i have it only took me about two minutes i m a very rapid packer

one thing about packing depressed me a little i had to pack these brand new ice

skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before that depressed

me i could see my mother going in spaulding s and asking the salesman a million dopy

questions and here i was getting the ax again it made me feel pretty sad she bought me

the wrong kind of skates i wanted racing skates and she bought hockey but it made me

sad anyway almost every time somebody gives me a present it ends up making me sad

after i got all packed i sort of counted my dough i don t remember exactly how

much i had but i was pretty loaded my grandmother d just sent me a wad about a week

before i have this grandmother that s quite lavish with her dough she doesn t have all

her marbles any more she s old as hell and she keeps sending me money for my

birthday about four times a year anyway even though i was pretty loaded i figured i

could always use a few extra bucks you never know so what i did was i went down the

hail and woke up frederick woodruff this guy i d lent my typewriter to i asked him how

much he d give me for it he was a pretty wealthy guy he said he didn t know he said

he didn t much want to buy it finally he bought it though it cost about ninety bucks

and all he bought it for was twenty he was sore because i d woke him up

when i was all set to go when i had my bags and all i stood for a while next to

the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor i was sort of crying i don t

know why i put my red hunting hat on and turned the peak around to the back the way i

liked it and then i yelled at the top of my goddam voice sleep tight ya morons i ll bet

i woke up every bastard on the whole floor then i got the hell out some stupid guy had

thrown peanut shells all over the stairs and i damn near broke my crazy neck

8

it was too late to call up for a cab or anything so i walked the whole way to the

station it wasn t too far but it was cold as hell and the snow made it hard for walking

and my gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs i sort of enjoyed the air and all

though the only trouble was the cold made my nose hurt and right under my upper lip

where old stradlater d laid one on me he d smacked my lip right on my teeth and it was

pretty sore my ears were nice and warm though that hat i bought had earlaps in it and

i put them on i didn t give a damn how i looked nobody was around anyway

everybody was in the sack

i was quite lucky when i got to the station because i only had to wait about ten

minutes for a train while i waited i got some snow in my hand and washed my face

with it i still had quite a bit of blood on

usually i like riding on trains especially at night with the lights on and the

windows so black and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and

sandwiches and magazines i usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines if

i m on a train at night i can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine

without puking you know one of those stories with a lot of phony lean jawed guys

named david in it and a lot of phony girls named linda or marcia that are always

lighting all the goddam davids pipes for them i can even read one of those lousy stories

on a train at night usually but this time it was different i just didn t feel like it i just

sort of sat and not did anything all i did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my

pocket

all of a sudden this lady got on at trenton and sat down next to me practically

the whole car was empty because it was pretty late and all but she sat down next to me

instead of an empty seat because she had this big bag with her and i was sitting in the

front seat she stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle where the conductor and

everybody could trip over it she had these orchids on like she d just been to a big party

or something she was around forty or forty five i guess but she was very good looking

women kill me they really do i don t mean i m oversexed or anything like that

although i am quite sexy i just like them i mean they re always leaving their goddam

bags out in the middle of the aisle

anyway we were sitting there and all of a sudden she said to me excuse me

but isn t that a pencey prep sticker she was looking up at my suitcases up on the rack

yes it is i said she was right i did have a goddam pencey sticker on one of

my gladstones very corny i ll admit

oh do you go to pencey she said she had a nice voice a nice telephone

voice mostly she should ve carried a goddam telephone around with her

yes i do i said

oh how lovely perhaps you know my son then ernest morrow he goes to

pencey

yes i do he s in my class

her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to pencey in the whole

crumby history of the school he was always going down the corridor after he d had a

shower snapping his soggy old wet towel at people s asses that s exactly the kind of a

guy he was

oh how nice the lady said but not corny she was just nice and all i must

tell ernest we met she said may i ask your name dear

rudolf schmidt i told her i didn t feel like giving her my whole life history

rudolf schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm

do you like pencey she asked me

pencey it s not too bad it s not paradise or anything but it s as good as most

schools some of the faculty are pretty conscientious

ernest just adores it

i know he does i said then i started shooting the old crap around a little bit

he adapts himself very well to things he really does i mean he really knows how to

adapt himself

do you think so she asked me she sounded interested as hell

ernest sure i said then i watched her take off her gloves boy was she lousy

with rocks

i just broke a nail getting out of a cab she said she looked up at me and sort of

smiled she had a terrifically nice smile she really did most people have hardly any

smile at all or a lousy one ernest s father and i sometimes worry about him she said

we sometimes feel he s not a terribly good mixer

how do you mean

well he s a very sensitive boy he s really never been a terribly good mixer with

other boys perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age

sensitive that killed me that guy morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam

toilet seat

i gave her a good look she didn t look like any dope to me she looked like she

might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of but you can t

always tell with somebody s mother i mean mothers are all slightly insane the thing

is though i liked old morrow s mother she was all right would you care for a

cigarette i asked her

she looked all around i don t believe this is a smoker rudolf she said rudolf

that killed me

that s all right we can smoke till they start screaming at us i said she took a

cigarette off me and i gave her a light

she looked nice smoking she inhaled and all but she didn t wolf the smoke

down the way most women around her age do she had a lot of charm she had quite a

lot of sex appeal too if you really want to know

she was looking at me sort of funny i may be wrong but i believe your nose is

bleeding dear she said all of a sudden

i nodded and took out my handkerchief i got hit with a snowball i said one

of those very icy ones i probably would ve told her what really happened but it

would ve taken too long i liked her though i was beginning to feel sort of sorry i d told

her my name was rudolf schmidt old ernie i said he s one of the most popular

boys at pencey did you know that

no i didn t

i nodded it really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him he s a

funny guy a strange guy in lots of ways know what i mean like when i first met him

when i first met him i thought he was kind of a snobbish person that s what i thought

but he isn t he s just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get

to know him

old mrs morrow didn t say anything but boy you should ve seen her i had her

glued to her seat you take somebody s mother all they want to hear about is what a hot

shot their son is

then i really started chucking the old crap around did he tell you about the

elections i asked her the class elections

she shook her head i had her in a trance like i really did

well a bunch of us wanted old ernie to be president of the class i mean he was

the unanimous choice i mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job i

said boy was i chucking it but this other boy harry fencer was elected and the

reason he was elected the simple and obvious reason was because ernie wouldn t let us

nominate him because he s so darn shy and modest and all he refused boy he s

really shy you oughta make him try to get over that i looked at her didn t he tell you

about it

no he didn t

i nodded that s ernie he wouldn t that s the one fault with him he s too shy

and modest you really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally

right that minute the conductor came around for old mrs morrow s ticket and it

gave me a chance to quit shooting it i m glad i shot it for a while though you take a guy

like morrow that s always snapping their towel at people s asses really trying to hurt

somebody with it they don t just stay a rat while they re a kid they stay a rat their whole

life but i ll bet after all the crap i shot mrs morrow ll keep thinking of him now as this

very shy modest guy that wouldn t let us nominate him for president she might you

can t tell mothers aren t too sharp about that stuff

would you care for a cocktail i asked her i was feeling in the mood for one

myself we can go in the club car all right

dear are you allowed to order drinks she asked me not snotty though she

was too charming and all to be snotty

well no not exactly but i can usually get them on account of my heighth i

said and i have quite a bit of gray hair i turned sideways and showed her my gray

hair it fascinated hell out of her c mon join me why don t you i said i d ve enjoyed

having her

i really don t think i d better thank you so much though dear she said

anyway the club car s most likely closed it s quite late you know she was right i d

forgotten all about what time it was

then she looked at me and asked me what i was afraid she was going to ask me

ernest wrote that he d be home on wednesday that christmas vacation would start on

wednesday she said i hope you weren t called home suddenly because of illness in the

family she really looked worried about it she wasn t just being nosy you could tell

no everybody s fine at home i said it s me i have to have this operation

oh i m so sorry she said she really was too i was right away sorry i d said it

but it was too late

it isn t very serious i have this tiny little tumor on the brain

oh no she put her hand up to her mouth and all oh i ll be all right and

everything it s right near the outside and it s a very tiny one they can take it out in

about two minutes

then i started reading this timetable i had in my pocket just to stop lying once i

get started i can go on for hours if i feel like it no kidding hours

we didn t talk too much after that she started reading this vogue she had with

her and i looked out the window for a while she got off at newark she wished me a lot

of luck with the operation and all she kept calling me rudolf then she invited me to

visit ernie during the summer at gloucester massachusetts she said their house was

right on the beach and they had a tennis court and all but i just thanked her and told her i

was going to south america with my grandmother which was really a hot one because

my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house except maybe to go to a goddam

matinee or something but i wouldn t visit that sonuvabitch morrow for all the dough in

the world even if i was desperate

9

the first thing i did when i got off at penn station i went into this phone booth i

felt like giving somebody a buzz i left my bags right outside the booth so that i could

watch them but as soon as i was inside i couldn t think of anybody to call up my

brother d b was in hollywood my kid sister phoebe goes to bed around nine o clock

so i couldn t call her up she wouldn t ve cared if i d woke her up but the trouble was she

wouldn t ve been the one that answered the phone my parents would be the ones so that

was out then i thought of giving jane gallagher s mother a buzz and find out when

jane s vacation started but i didn t feel like it besides it was pretty late to call up then i

thought of calling this girl i used to go around with quite frequently sally hayes

because i knew her christmas vacation had started already she d written me this long

phony letter inviting me over to help her trim the christmas tree christmas eve and all

but i was afraid her mother d answer the phone her mother knew my mother and i could

picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother i was in new

york besides i wasn t crazy about talking to old mrs hayes on the phone she once told

sally i was wild she said i was wild and that i had no direction in life then i thought of

calling up this guy that went to the whooton school when i was there carl luce but i

didn t like him much so i ended up not calling anybody i came out of the booth after

about twenty minutes or so and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the

cabs are and got a cab

i m so damn absent minded i gave the driver my regular address just out of habit

and all i mean i completely forgot i was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days

and not go home till vacation started i didn t think of it till we were halfway through the

park then i said hey do you mind turning around when you get a chance i gave you

the wrong address i want to go back downtown

the driver was sort of a wise guy i can t turn around here mac this here s a

one way i ll have to go all the way to ninedieth street now

i didn t want to start an argument okay i said then i thought of something all

of a sudden hey listen i said you know those ducks in that lagoon right near

central park south that little lake by any chance do you happen to know where they

go the ducks when it gets all frozen over do you happen to know by any chance i

realized it was only one chance in a million

he turned around and looked at me like i was a madman what re ya tryna do

bud he said kid me

no i was just interested that s all

he didn t say anything more so i didn t either until we came out of the park at

ninetieth street then he said all right buddy where to

well the thing is i don t want to stay at any hotels on the east side where i

might run into some acquaintances of mine i m traveling incognito i said i hate saying

corny things like traveling incognito but when i m with somebody that s corny i

always act corny too do you happen to know whose band s at the taft or the new

yorker by any chance

no idear mac

well take me to the edmont then i said would you care to stop on the way

and join me for a cocktail on me i m loaded

can t do it mac sorry he certainly was good company terrific personality

we got to the edmont hotel and i checked in i d put on my red hunting cap

when i was in the cab just for the hell of it but i took it off before i checked in i didn t

want to look like a screwball or something which is really ironic i didn t know then that

the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons screwballs all over the place

they gave me this very crumby room with nothing to look out of the window at

except the other side of the hotel i didn t care much i was too depressed to care whether

i had a good view or not the bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy

around sixty five he was even more depressing than the room was he was one of those

bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness i d rather be

bald than do that anyway what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty five years old

carrying people s suitcases and waiting around for a tip i suppose he wasn t too

intelligent or anything but it was terrible anyway

after he left i looked out the window for a while with my coat on and all i didn t

have anything else to do you d be surprised what was going on on the other side of the

hotel they didn t even bother to pull their shades down i saw one guy a gray haired

very distinguished looking guy with only his shorts on do something you wouldn t

believe me if i told you first he put his suitcase on the bed then he took out all these

women s clothes and put them on real women s clothes silk stockings high heeled

shoes brassiere and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all then he

put on this very tight black evening dress i swear to god then he started walking up and

down the room taking these very small steps the way a woman does and smoking a

cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror he was all alone too unless somebody

was in the bathroom i couldn t see that much then in the window almost right over his

i saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other it probably

was highballs not water but i couldn t see what they had in their glasses anyway first

he d take a swallow and squirt it all over her then she did it to him they took turns for

god s sake you should ve seen them they were in hysterics the whole time like it was

the funniest thing that ever happened i m not kidding the hotel was lousy with perverts i

was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place and that isn t saying much i

damn near sent a telegram to old stradlater telling him to take the first train to new york

he d have been the king of the hotel

the trouble was that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch even if you don t

want it to be for instance that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face she

was pretty good looking i mean that s my big trouble in my mind i m probably the

biggest sex maniac you ever saw sometimes i can think of very crumby stuff i wouldn t

mind doing if the opportunity came up i can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun

in a crumby way and if you were both sort of drunk and all to get a girl and squirt water

or something all over each other s face the thing is though i don t like the idea it

stinks if you analyze it i think if you don t really like a girl you shouldn t horse around

with her at all and if you do like her then you re supposed to like her face and if you

like her face you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it like squirting water

all over it it s really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes girls

aren t too much help either when you start trying not to get too crumby when you start

trying not to spoil anything really good i knew this one girl a couple of years ago that

was even crumbier than i was boy was she crumby we had a lot of fun though for a

while in a crumby way sex is something i really don t understand too hot you never

know where the hell you are i keep making up these sex rules for myself and then i

break them right away last year i made a rule that i was going to quit horsing around

with girls that deep down gave me a pain in the ass i broke it though the same week i

made it the same night as a matter of fact i spent the whole night necking with a

terrible phony named anne louise sherman sex is something i just don t understand i

swear to god i don t

i started toying with the idea while i kept standing there of giving old jane a

buzz i mean calling her long distance at b m where she went instead of calling up her

mother to find out when she was coming home you weren t supposed to call students up

late at night but i had it all figured out i was going to tell whoever answered the phone

that i was her uncle i was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and i

had to speak to her immediately it would ve worked too the only reason i didn t do it

was because i wasn t in the mood if you re not in the mood you can t do that stuff right

after a while i sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes i was

feeling pretty horny i have to admit it then all of a sudden i got this idea i took out

my wallet and started looking for this address a guy i met at a party last summer that

went to princeton gave me finally i found it it was all a funny color from my wallet

but you could still read it it was the address of this girl that wasn t exactly a whore or

anything but that didn t mind doing it once in a while this princeton guy told me he

brought her to a dance at princeton once and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her

she used to be a burlesque stripper or something anyway i went over to the phone and

gave her a buzz her name was faith cavendish and she lived at the stanford arms

hotel on sixty fifth and broadway a dump no doubt

for a while i didn t think she was home or something nobody kept answering

then finally somebody picked up the phone

hello i said i made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn t suspect my age

or anything i have a pretty deep voice anyway

hello this woman s voice said none too friendly either

is this miss faith cavendish

who s this she said who s calling me up at this crazy goddam hour

that sort of scared me a little bit well i know it s quite late i said in this very

mature voice and all i hope you ll forgive me but i was very anxious to get in touch

with you i said it suave as hell i really did

who is this she said

well you don t know me but i m a friend of eddie birdsell s he suggested that

if i were in town sometime we ought to get together for a cocktail or two

who you re a friend of who boy she was a real tigress over the phone she

was damn near yelling at me

edmund birdsell eddie birdsell i said i couldn t remember if his name was

edmund or edward i only met him once at a goddam stupid party

i don t know anybody by that name jack and if you think i enjoy bein woke up

in the middle

eddie birdsell from princeton i said

you could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all

birdsell birdsell from princeton princeton college

that s right i said

you from princeton college

well approximately

oh how is eddie she said this is certainly a peculiar time to call a person

up though jesus christ

he s fine he asked to be remembered to you

well thank you remember me to him she said he s a grand person what s

he doing now she was getting friendly as hell all of a sudden

oh you know same old stuff i said how the hell did i know what he was

doing i hardly knew the guy i didn t even know if he was still at princeton look i

said would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere

by any chance do you have any idea what time it is she said what s your

name anyhow may i ask she was getting an english accent all of a sudden you

sound a little on the young side

i laughed thank you for the compliment i said suave as hell holden

caulfield s my name i should ve given her a phony name but i didn t think of it

well look mr cawffle i m not in the habit of making engagements in the

middle of the night i m a working gal

tomorrow s sunday i told her

well anyway i gotta get my beauty sleep you know how it is

i thought we might have just one cocktail together it isn t too late

well you re very sweet she said where ya callin from where ya at now

anyways

me i m in a phone booth

oh she said then there was this very long pause well i d like awfully to get

together with you sometime mr cawffle you sound very attractive you sound like a

very attractive person but it is late

i could come up to your place

well ordinary i d say grand i mean i d love to have you drop up for a cocktail

but my roommate happens to be ill she s been laying here all night without a wink of

sleep she just this minute closed her eyes and all i mean

oh that s too bad

where ya stopping at perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow

i can t make it tomorrow i said tonight s the only time i can make it what a

dope i was i shouldn t ve said that

oh well i m awfully sorry

i know it is thanks good night i said then i hung up

boy i really fouled that up i should ve at least made it for cocktails or something

10

it was still pretty early i m not sure what time it was but it wasn t too late the

one thing i hate to do is go to bed when i m not even tired so i opened my suitcases and

took out a clean shirt and then i went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt

what i thought i d do i thought i d go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in

the lavender room they had this night club the lavender room in the hotel

while i was changing my shirt i damn near gave my kid sister phoebe a buzz

though i certainly felt like talking to her on the phone somebody with sense and all but

i couldn t take a chance on giving her a buzz because she was only a little kid and she

wouldn t have been up let alone anywhere near the phone i thought of maybe hanging

up if my parents answered but that wouldn t ve worked either they d know it was me

my mother always knows it s me she s psychic but i certainly wouldn t have minded

shooting the crap with old phoebe for a while

you should see her you never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole

life she s really smart i mean she s had all a s ever since she started school as a matter

of fact i m the only dumb one in the family my brother d b s a writer and all and my

brother allie the one that died that i told you about was a wizard i m the only really

dumb one but you ought to see old phoebe she has this sort of red hair a little bit like

allie s was that s very short in the summertime in the summertime she sticks it behind

her ears she has nice pretty little ears in the wintertime it s pretty long though

sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn t it s really nice though she s

only ten she s quite skinny like me but nice skinny roller skate skinny i watched her

once from the window when she was crossing over fifth avenue to go to the park and

that s what she is roller skate skinny you d like her i mean if you tell old phoebe

something she knows exactly what the hell you re talking about i mean you can even

take her anywhere with you if you take her to a lousy movie for instance she knows it s

a lousy movie if you take her to a pretty good movie she knows it s a pretty good movie

d b and i took her to see this french movie the baker s wife with raimu in it it killed

her her favorite is the 39 steps though with robert donat she knows the whole

goddam movie by heart because i ve taken her to see it about ten times when old donat

comes up to this scotch farmhouse for instance when he s running away from the cops

and all phoebe ll say right out loud in the movie right when the scotch guy in the

picture says it can you eat the herring she knows all the talk by heart and when this

professor in the picture that s really a german spy sticks up his little finger with part of

the middle joint missing to show robert donat old phoebe beats him to it she holds up

her little finger at me in the dark right in front of my face she s all right you d like her

the only trouble is she s a little too affectionate sometimes she s very emotional for a

child she really is something else she does she writes books all the time only she

doesn t finish them they re all about some kid named hazel weatherfield only old

phoebe spells it hazle old hazle weatherfield is a girl detective she s supposed to be

an orphan but her old man keeps showing up her old man s always a tall attractive

gentleman about 20 years of age that kills me old phoebe i swear to god you d like

her she was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid when she was a very tiny

little kid i and allie used to take her to the park with us especially on sundays allie had

this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on sundays and we used to take old

phoebe with us she d wear white gloves and walk right between us like a lady and all

and when allie and i were having some conversation about things in general old

phoebe d be listening sometimes you d forget she was around because she was such a

little kid but she d let you know she d interrupt you all the time she d give allie or i a

push or something and say who who said that bobby or the lady and we d tell her

who said it and she d say oh and go right on listening and all she killed allie too i

mean he liked her too she s ten now and not such a tiny little kid any more but she still

kills everybody everybody with any sense anyway

anyway she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone but i

was too afraid my parents would answer and then they d find out i was in new york and

kicked out of pencey and all so i just finished putting on my shirt then i got all ready

and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on

except for a few pimpy looking guys and a few whory looking blondes the

lobby was pretty empty but you could hear the band playing in the lavender room and

so i went in there it wasn t very crowded but they gave me a lousy table anyway way in

the back i should ve waved a buck under the head waiter s nose in new york boy

money really talks i m not kidding

the band was putrid buddy singer very brassy but not good brassy corny

brassy also there were very few people around my age in the place in fact nobody was

around my age they were mostly old show offy looking guys with their dates except at

the table right next to me at the table right next to me there were these three girls

around thirty or so the whole three of them were pretty ugly and they all had on the

kind of hats that you knew they didn t really live in new york but one of them the

blonde one wasn t too bad she was sort of cute the blonde one and i started giving her

the old eye a little bit but just then the waiter came up for my order i ordered a scotch

and soda and told him not to mix it i said it fast as hell because if you hem and haw

they think you re under twenty one and won t sell you any intoxicating liquor i had

trouble with him anyway though i m sorry sir he said but do you have some

verification of your age your driver s license perhaps

i gave him this very cold stare like he d insulted the hell out of me and asked

him do i look like i m under twenty one

i m sorry sir but we have our

okay okay i said i figured the hell with it bring me a coke he started to

go away but i called him back can tcha stick a little rum in it or something i asked

him i asked him very nicely and all i can t sit in a corny place like this cold sober

can tcha stick a little rum in it or something

i m very sorry sir he said and beat it on me i didn t hold it against him

though they lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor i m a goddam minor

i started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again that is the

blonde one the other two were strictly from hunger i didn t do it crudely though i just

gave all three of them this very cool glance and all what they did though the three of

them when i did it they started giggling like morons they probably thought i was too

young to give anybody the once over that annoyed hell out of me you d ve thought i

wanted to marry them or something i should ve given them the freeze after they did that

but the trouble was i really felt like dancing i m very fond of dancing sometimes and

that was one of the times so all of a sudden i sort of leaned over and said would any

of you girls care to dance i didn t ask them crudely or anything very suave in fact but

god damn it they thought that was a panic too they started giggling some more i m

not kidding they were three real morons c mon i said i ll dance with you one at a

time all right how bout it c mon i really felt like dancing

finally the blonde one got up to dance with me because you could tell i was

really talking to her and we walked out to the dance floor the other two grools nearly

had hysterics when we did i certainly must ve been very hard up to even bother with any

of them

but it was worth it the blonde was some dancer she was one of the best dancers

i ever danced with i m not kidding some of these very stupid girls can really knock you

out on a dance floor you take a really smart girl and half the time she s trying to lead

you around the dance floor or else she s such a lousy dancer the best thing to do is stay

at the table and just get drunk with her

you really can dance i told the blonde one you oughta be a pro i mean it i

danced with a pro once and you re twice as good as she was did you ever hear of marco

and miranda

what she said she wasn t even listening to me she was looking all around the

place

i said did you ever hear of marco and miranda

i don t know no i don t know

well they re dancers she s a dancer she s not too hot though she does

everything she s supposed to but she s not so hot anyway you know when a girl s really

a terrific dancer

wudga say she said she wasn t listening to me even her mind was

wandering all over the place

i said do you know when a girl s really a terrific dancer

uh uh

well where i have my hand on your back if i think there isn t anything

underneath my hand no can no legs no feet no anything then the girl s really a terrific

dancer

she wasn t listening though so i ignored her for a while we just danced god

could that dopey girl dance buddy singer and his stinking band was playing just one of

those things and even they couldn t ruin it entirely it s a swell song i didn t try any

trick stuff while we danced i hate a guy that does a lot of show off tricky stuff on the

dance floor but i was moving her around plenty and she stayed with me the funny

thing is i thought she was enjoying it too till all of a sudden she came out with this very

dumb remark i and my girl friends saw peter lorre last night she said the movie

actor in person he was buyin a newspaper he s cute

you re lucky i told her you re really lucky you know that she was really a

moron but what a dancer i could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the

top of her dopey head you know right where the part is and all she got sore when i

did it

hey what s the idea

nothing no idea you really can dance i said i have a kid sister that s only in

the goddam fourth grade you re about as good as she is and she can dance better than

anybody living or dead

watch your language if you don t mind

what a lady boy a queen for chrissake

where you girls from i asked her

she didn t answer me though she was busy looking around for old peter lorre to

show up i guess

where you girls from i asked her again

what she said

where you girls from don t answer if you don t feel like it i don t want you to

strain yourself

seattle washington she said she was doing me a big favor to tell me

you re a very good conversationalist i told her you know that

what

i let it drop it was over her head anyway do you feel like jitterbugging a little

bit if they play a fast one not corny jitterbug not jump or anything just nice and easy

everybody ll all sit down when they play a fast one except the old guys and the fat guys

and we ll have plenty of room okay

it s immaterial to me she said hey how old are you anyhow

that annoyed me for some reason oh christ don t spoil it i said i m

twelve for chrissake i m big for my age

listen i toleja about that i don t like that type language she said if you re

gonna use that type language i can go sit down with my girl friends you know

i apologized like a madman because the band was starting a fast one she started

jitterbugging with me but just very nice and easy not corny she was really good all

you had to do was touch her and when she turned around her pretty little butt twitched

so nice and all she knocked me out i mean it i was half in love with her by the time we

sat down that s the thing about girls every time they do something pretty even if

they re not much to look at or even if they re sort of stupid you fall half in love with

them and then you never know where the hell you are girls jesus christ they can

drive you crazy they really can

they didn t invite me to sit down at their table mostly because they were too

ignorant but i sat down anyway the blonde i d been dancing with s name was bernice

something crabs or krebs the two ugly ones names were marty and laverne i told

them my name was jim steele just for the hell of it then i tried to get them in a little

intelligent conversation but it was practically impossible you had to twist their arms

you could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them and the whole three

of them kept looking all around the goddam room like as if they expected a flock of

goddam movie stars to come in any minute they probably thought movie stars always

hung out in the lavender room when they came to new york instead of the stork club

or el morocco and all anyway it took me about a half hour to find out where they all

worked and all in seattle they all worked in the same insurance office i asked them if

they liked it but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three

dopes i thought the two ugly ones marty and laverne were sisters but they got very

insulted when i asked them you could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the

other one and you couldn t blame them but it was very amusing anyway

i danced with them all the whole three of them one at a time the one ugly one

laverne wasn t too bad a dancer but the other one old marty was murder old marty

was like dragging the statue of liberty around the floor the only way i could even half

enjoy myself dragging her around was if i amused myself a little so i told her i just saw

gary cooper the movie star on the other side of the floor

where she asked me excited as hell where

aw you just missed him he just went out why didn t you look when i told

you

she practically stopped dancing and started looking over everybody s heads to

see if she could see him oh shoot she said i d just about broken her heart i really

had i was sorry as hell i d kidded her some people you shouldn t kid even if they

deserve it

here s what was very funny though when we got back to the table old marty

told the other two that gary cooper had just gone out boy old laverne and bernice

nearly committed suicide when they heard that they got all excited and asked marty if

she d seen him and all old mart said she d only caught a glimpse of him that killed me

the bar was closing up for the night so i bought them all two drinks apiece quick

before it closed and i ordered two more cokes for myself the goddam table was lousy

with glasses the one ugly one laverne kept kidding me because i was only drinking

cokes she had a sterling sense of humor she and old marty were drinking tom

collinses in the middle of december for god s sake they didn t know any better the

blonde one old bernice was drinking bourbon and water she was really putting it away

too the whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time they hardly

talked even to each other old marty talked more than the other two she kept saying

these very corny boring things like calling the can the little girls room and she

thought buddy singer s poor old beat up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood

up and took a couple of ice cold hot licks she called his clarinet a licorice stick was

she corny the other ugly one laverne thought she was a very witty type she kept

asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight she kept asking

me if my father had a date or not four times she asked me that she was certainly witty

old bernice the blonde one didn t say hardly anything at all every time i d ask her

something she said what that can get on your nerves after a while

all of a sudden when they finished their drink all three of them stood up on me

and said they had to get to bed they said they were going to get up early to see the first

show at radio city music hall i tried to get them to stick around for a while but they

wouldn t so we said good by and all i told them i d look them up in seattle sometime if

i ever got there but i doubt if i ever will look them up i mean

with cigarettes and all the check came to about thirteen bucks i think they

should ve at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before i joined them i

wouldn t ve let them naturally but they should ve at least offered i didn t care much

though they were so ignorant and they had those sad fancy hats on and all and that

business about getting up early to see the first show at radio city music hall depressed

me if somebody some girl in an awful looking hat for instance comes all the way to

new york from seattle washington for god s sake and ends up getting up early in the

morning to see the goddam first show at radio city music hall it makes me so

depressed i can t stand it i d ve bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only

they hadn t told me that

i left the lavender room pretty soon after they did they were closing it up

anyway and the band had quit a long time ago in the first place it was one of those

places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with or

unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just cokes there isn t any night club

in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get

drunk or unless you re with some girl that really knocks you out

11

all of a sudden on my way out to the lobby i got old jane gallagher on the brain

again i got her on and i couldn t get her off i sat down in this vomity looking chair in

the lobby and thought about her and stradlater sitting in that goddam ed banky s car and

though i was pretty damn sure old stradlater hadn t given her the time i know old jane

like a book i still couldn t get her off my brain i knew her like a book i really did i

mean besides checkers she was quite fond of all athletic sports and after i got to know

her the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf

almost every afternoon i really got to know her quite intimately i don t mean it was

anything physical or anything it wasn t but we saw each other all the time you don t

always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl

the way i met her this doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve

himself on our lawn and my mother got very irritated about it she called up jane s

mother and made a big stink about it my mother can make a very big stink about that

kind of stuff then what happened a couple of days later i saw jane laying on her

stomach next to the swimming pool at the club and i said hello to her i knew she lived

in the house next to ours but i d never conversed with her before or anything she gave

me the big freeze when i said hello that day though i had a helluva time convincing her

that i didn t give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself he could do it in the

living room for all i cared anyway after that jane and i got to be friends and all i

played golf with her that same afternoon she lost eight balls i remember eight i had a

terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball i

improved her game immensely though i m a very good golfer if i told you what i go

around in you probably wouldn t believe me i almost was once in a movie short but i

changed my mind at the last minute i figured that anybody that hates the movies as much

as i do i d be a phony if i let them stick me in a movie short

she was a funny girl old jane i wouldn t exactly describe her as strictly beautiful

she knocked me out though she was sort of muckle mouthed i mean when she was

talking and she got excited about something her mouth sort of went in about fifty

directions her lips and all that killed me and she never really closed it all the way her

mouth it was always just a little bit open especially when she got in her golf stance or

when she was reading a book she was always reading and she read very good books

she read a lot of poetry and all she was the only one outside my family that i ever

showed allie s baseball mitt to with all the poems written on it she d never met allie or

anything because that was her first summer in maine before that she went to cape cod

but i told her quite a lot about him she was interested in that kind of stuff

my mother didn t like her too much i mean my mother always thought jane and

her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn t say hello my

mother saw them in the village a lot because jane used to drive to market with her

mother in this lasalle convertible they had my mother didn t think jane was pretty

even i did though i just liked the way she looked that s all

i remember this one afternoon it was the only time old jane and i ever got close

to necking even it was a saturday and it was raining like a bastard out and i was over at

her house on the porch they had this big screened in porch we were playing checkers i

used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn t take her kings out of the back row

but i didn t kid her much though you never wanted to kid jane too much i think i really

like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises but it s a

funny thing the girls i like best are the ones i never feel much like kidding sometimes i

think they d like it if you kidded them in fact i know they would but it s hard to get

started once you ve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them anyway i

was telling you about that afternoon jane and i came close to necking it was raining like

hell and we were out on her porch and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was

married to came out on the porch and asked jane if there were any cigarettes in the house

i didn t know him too well or anything but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn t

talk to you much unless he wanted something off you he had a lousy personality

anyway old jane wouldn t answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was

any cigarettes so the guy asked her again but she still wouldn t answer him she didn t

even look up from the game finally the guy went inside the house when he did i asked

jane what the hell was going on she wouldn t even answer me then she made out like

she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all then all of a sudden this

tear plopped down on the checkerboard on one of the red squares boy i can still see it

she just rubbed it into the board with her finger i don t know why but it bothered hell

out of me so what i did was i went over and made her move over on the glider so that i

could sit down next to her i practically sat down in her lap as a matter of fact then she

really started to cry and the next thing i knew i was kissing her all over anywhere her

eyes her nose her forehead her eyebrows and all her ears her whole face except her

mouth and all she sort of wouldn t let me get to her mouth anyway it was the closest

we ever got to necking after a while she got up and went in and put on this red and

white sweater she had that knocked me out and we went to a goddam movie i asked

her on the way if mr cudahy that was the booze hound s name had ever tried to get

wise with her she was pretty young but she had this terrific figure and i wouldn t ve put

it past that cudahy bastard she said no though i never did find out what the hell was the

matter some girls you practically never find out what s the matter

i don t want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something just

because we never necked or horsed around much she wasn t i held hands with her all

the time for instance that doesn t sound like much i realize but she was terrific to hold

hands with most girls if you hold hands with them their goddam hand dies on you or

else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time as if they were afraid

they d bore you or something jane was different we d get into a goddam movie or

something and right away we d start holding hands and we wouldn t quit till the movie

was over and without changing the position or making a big deal out of it you never

even worried with jane whether your hand was sweaty or not all you knew was you

were happy you really were

one other thing i just thought of one time in this movie jane did something that

just about knocked me out the newsreel was on or something and all of a sudden i felt

this hand on the back of my neck and it was jane s it was a funny thing to do i mean

she was quite young and all and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back

of somebody s neck they re around twenty five or thirty and usually they re doing it to

their husband or their little kid i do it to my kid sister phoebe once in a while for

instance but if a girl s quite young and all and she does it it s so pretty it just about kills

you

anyway that s what i was thinking about while i sat in that vomity looking chair

in the lobby old jane every time i got to the part about her out with stradlater in that

damn ed banky s car it almost drove me crazy i knew she wouldn t let him get to first

base with her but it drove me crazy anyway i don t even like to talk about it if you want

to know the truth

there was hardly anybody in the lobby any more even all the whory looking

blondes weren t around any more and all of a sudden i felt like getting the hell out of the

place it was too depressing and i wasn t tired or anything so i went up to my room and

put on my coat i also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in

action but the lights and all were out now i went down in the elevator again and got a

cab and told the driver to take me down to ernie s ernie s is this night club in greenwich

village that my brother d b used to go to quite frequently before he went out to

hollywood and prostituted himself he used to take me with him once in a while ernie s

a big fat colored guy that plays the piano he s a terrific snob and he won t hardly even

talk to you unless you re a big shot or a celebrity or something but he can really play the

piano he s so good he s almost corny in fact i don t exactly know what i mean by that

but i mean it i certainly like to hear him play but sometimes you feel like turning his

goddam piano over i think it s because sometimes when he plays he sounds like the kind

of guy that won t talk to you unless you re a big shot

12

the cab i had was a real old one that smelled like someone d just tossed his

cookies in it i always get those vomity kind of cabs if i go anywhere late at night what

made it worse it was so quiet and lonesome out even though it was saturday night i

didn t see hardly anybody on the street now and then you just saw a man and a girl

crossing a street with their arms around each other s waists and all or a bunch of

hoodlumy looking guys and their dates all of them laughing like hyenas at something

you could bet wasn t funny new york s terrible when somebody laughs on the street very

late at night you can hear it for miles it makes you feel so lonesome and depressed i

kept wishing i could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old phoebe but finally

after i was riding a while the cab driver and i sort of struck up a conversation his name

was horwitz he was a much better guy than the other driver i d had anyway i thought

maybe he might know about the ducks

hey horwitz i said you ever pass by the lagoon in central park down by

central park south

the what

the lagoon that little lake like there where the ducks are you know

yeah what about it

well you know the ducks that swim around in it in the springtime and all do

you happen to know where they go in the wintertime by any chance

where who goes

the ducks do you know by any chance i mean does somebody come around

in a truck or something and take them away or do they fly away by themselves go south

or something

old horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me he was a very

impatient type guy he wasn t a bad guy though how the hell should i know he said

how the hell should i know a stupid thing like that

well don t get sore about it i said he was sore about it or something

who s sore nobody s sore

i stopped having a conversation with him if he was going to get so damn touchy

about it but he started it up again himself he turned all the way around again and said

the fish don t go no place they stay right where they are the fish right in the goddam

lake

the fish that s different the fish is different i m talking about the ducks i

said

what s different about it nothin s different about it horwitz said everything

he said he sounded sore about something it s tougher for the fish the winter and all

than it is for the ducks for chrissake use your head for chrissake

i didn t say anything for about a minute then i said all right what do they do

the fish and all when that whole little lake s a solid block of ice people skating on it and

all

old horwitz turned around again what the hellaya mean what do they do he

yelled at me they stay right where they are for chrissake

they can t just ignore the ice they can t just ignore it

who s ignoring it nobody s ignoring it horwitz said he got so damn excited

and all i was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something

they live right in the goddam ice it s their nature for chrissake they get frozen right

in one position for the whole winter

yeah what do they eat then i mean if they re frozen solid they can t swim

around looking for food and all

their bodies for chrissake what sa matter with ya their bodies take in

nutrition and all right through the goddam seaweed and crap that s in the ice they got

their pores open the whole time that s their nature for chrissake see what i mean he

turned way the hell around again to look at me

oh i said i let it drop i was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or

something besides he was such a touchy guy it wasn t any pleasure discussing anything

with him would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere i said

he didn t answer me though i guess he was still thinking i asked him again

though he was a pretty good guy quite amusing and all

i ain t got no time for no liquor bud he said how the hell old are you

anyways why ain tcha home in bed

i m not tired

when i got out in front of ernie s and paid the fare old horwitz brought up the

fish again he certainly had it on his mind listen he said if you was a fish mother

nature d take care of you wouldn t she right you don t think them fish just die when it

gets to be winter do ya

no but

you re goddam right they don t horwitz said and drove off like a bat out of

hell he was about the touchiest guy i ever met everything you said made him sore

even though it was so late old ernie s was jampacked mostly with prep school

jerks and college jerks almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for

christmas vacation than the schools i go to you could hardly check your coat it was so

crowded it was pretty quiet though because ernie was playing the piano it was

supposed to be something holy for god s sake when he sat down at the piano nobody s

that good about three couples besides me were waiting for tables and they were all

shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old ernie while he played he had a big

damn mirror in front of the piano with this big spotlight on him so that everybody could

watch his face while he played you couldn t see his fingers while he played just his big

old face big deal i m not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing

when i came in but whatever it was he was really stinking it up he was putting all these

dumb show offy ripples in the high notes and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives

me a pain in the ass you should ve heard the crowd though when he was finished you

would ve puked they went mad they were exactly the same morons that laugh like

hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn t funny i swear to god if i were a piano player or

an actor or something and all those dopes thought i was terrific i d hate it i wouldn t

even want them to clap for me people always clap for the wrong things if i were a piano

player i d play it in the goddam closet anyway when he was finished and everybody

was clapping their heads off old ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very

phony humble bow like as if he was a helluva humble guy besides being a terrific

piano player it was very phony i mean him being such a big snob and all in a funny

way though i felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished i don t even think he

knows any more when he s playing right or not it isn t all his fault i partly blame all

those dopes that clap their heads off they d foul up anybody if you gave them a chance

anyway it made me feel depressed and lousy again and i damn near got my coat back

and went back to the hotel but it was too early and i didn t feel much like being all alone

they finally got me this stinking table right up against a wall and behind a

goddam post where you couldn t see anything it was one of those tiny little tables that if

the people at the next table don t get up to let you by and they never do the bastards

you practically have to climb into your chair i ordered a scotch and soda which is my

favorite drink next to frozen daiquiris if you were only around six years old you could

get liquor at ernie s the place was so dark and all and besides nobody cared how old

you were you could even be a dope fiend and nobody d care

i was surrounded by jerks i m not kidding at this other tiny table right to my

left practically on top of me there was this funny looking guy and this funny looking

girl they were around my age or maybe just a little older it was funny you could see

they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast i listened to their

conversation for a while because i didn t have anything else to do he was telling her

about some pro football game he d seen that afternoon he gave her every single goddam

play in the whole game i m not kidding he was the most boring guy i ever listened to

and you could tell his date wasn t even interested in the goddam game but she was even

funnier looking than he was so i guess she had to listen real ugly girls have it tough i

feel so sorry for them sometimes sometimes i can t even look at them especially if

they re with some dopey guy that s telling them all about a goddam football game on my

right the conversation was even worse though on my right there was this very joe

yale looking guy in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty looking tattersall vests

all those ivy league bastards look alike my father wants me to go to yale or maybe

princeton but i swear i wouldn t go to one of those ivy league colleges if i was dying

for god s sake anyway this joe yale looking guy had a terrific looking girl with him

boy she was good looking but you should ve heard the conversation they were having

in the first place they were both slightly crocked what he was doing he was giving her

a feel under the table and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that

had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide his date kept saying to

him how horrible don t darling please don t not here imagine giving somebody

a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time they killed me

i certainly began to feel like a prize horse s ass though sitting there all by myself

there wasn t anything to do except smoke and drink what i did do though i told the

waiter to ask old ernie if he d care to join me for a drink i told him to tell him i was

d b s brother i don t think he ever even gave him my message though those bastards

never give your message to anybody

all of a sudden this girl came up to me and said holden caulfield her name

was lillian simmons my brother d b used to go around with her for a while she had

very big knockers

hi i said i tried to get up naturally but it was some job getting up in a place

like that she had some navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass

how marvelous to see you old lillian simmons said strictly a phony how s

your big brother that s all she really wanted to know

he s fine he s in hollywood

in hollywood how marvelous what s he doing

i don t know writing i said i didn t feel like discussing it you could tell she

thought it was a big deal his being in hollywood almost everybody does mostly people

who ve never read any of his stories it drives me crazy though

how exciting old lillian said then she introduced me to the navy guy his

name was commander blop or something he was one of those guys that think they re

being a pansy if they don t break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with

you god i hate that stuff are you all alone baby old lillian asked me she was

blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle you could tell she liked to block up a

lot of traffic this waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way but she didn t even

notice him it was funny you could tell the waiter didn t like her much you could tell

even the navy guy didn t like her much even though he was dating her and i didn t like

her much nobody did you had to feel sort of sorry for her in a way don t you have a

date baby she asked me i was standing up now and she didn t even tell me to sit

down she was the type that keeps you standing up for hours isn t he handsome she

said to the navy guy holden you re getting handsomer by the minute the navy guy

told her to come on he told her they were blocking up the whole aisle holden come

join us old lillian said bring your drink

i was just leaving i told her i have to meet somebody you could tell she was

just trying to get in good with me so that i d tell old d b about it

well you little so and so all right for you tell your big brother i hate him

when you see him

then she left the navy guy and i told each other we were glad to ve met each

other which always kills me i m always saying glad to ve met you to somebody i m

not at all glad i met if you want to stay alive you have to say that stuff though

after i d told her i had to meet somebody i didn t have any goddam choice except

to leave i couldn t even stick around to hear old ernie play something halfway decent

but i certainly wasn t going to sit down at a table with old lillian simmons and that navy

guy and be bored to death so i left it made me mad though when i was getting my

coat people are always ruining things for you

13

i walked all the way back to the hotel forty one gorgeous blocks i didn t do it

because i felt like walking or anything it was more because i didn t feel like getting in

and out of another taxicab sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way

you get tired riding in elevators all of a sudden you have to walk no matter how far or

how high up when i was a kid i used to walk all the way up to our apartment very

frequently twelve stories

you wouldn t even have known it had snowed at all there was hardly any snow

on the sidewalks but it was freezing cold and i took my red hunting hat out of my

pocket and put it on i didn t give a damn how i looked i even put the earlaps down i

wished i knew who d swiped my gloves at pencey because my hands were freezing not

that i d have done much about it even if i had known i m one of these very yellow guys i

try not to show it but i am for instance if i d found out at pencey who d stolen my

gloves i probably would ve gone down to the crook s room and said okay how bout

handing over those gloves then the crook that had stolen them probably would ve said

his voice very innocent and all what gloves then what i probably would ve done i d

have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere hidden in his goddam galoshes

or something for instance i d have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said

i suppose these are your goddam gloves then the crook probably would ve given me

this very phony innocent look and said i never saw those gloves before in my life if

they re yours take em i don t want the goddam things then i probably would ve just

stood there for about five minutes i d have the damn gloves right in my hand and all but

i d feel i ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something break his goddam jaw only i

wouldn t have the guts to do it i d just stand there trying to look tough what i might do

i might say something very cutting and snotty to rile him up instead of socking him in

the jaw anyway if i did say something very cutting and snotty he d probably get up and

come over to me and say listen caulfield are you calling me a crook then instead

of saying you re goddam right i am you dirty crooked bastard all i probably would ve

said would be all i know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes right

away then the guy would know for sure that i wasn t going to take a sock at him and he

probably would ve said listen let s get this straight are you calling me a thief then

i probably would ve said nobody s calling anybody a thief all i know is my gloves

were in your goddam galoshes it could go on like that for hours finally though i d

leave his room without even taking a sock at him i d probably go down to the can and

sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror anyway that s what i

thought about the whole way back to the hotel it s no fun to he yellow maybe i m not all

yellow i don t know i think maybe i m just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn t

give much of a damn if they lose their gloves one of my troubles is i never care too

much when i lose something it used to drive my mother crazy when i was a kid some

guys spend days looking for something they lost i never seem to have anything that if i

lost it i d care too much maybe that s why i m partly yellow it s no excuse though it

really isn t what you should be is not yellow at all if you re supposed to sock somebody

in the jaw and you sort of feel like doing it you should do it i m just no good at it

though i d rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock

him in the jaw i hate fist fights i don t mind getting hit so much although i m not crazy

about it naturally but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy s face i can t stand

looking at the other guy s face is my trouble it wouldn t be so bad if you could both be

blindfolded or something it s a funny kind of yellowness when you come to think of it

but it s yellowness all right i m not kidding myself

the more i thought about my gloves and my yellowness the more depressed i

got and i decided while i was walking and all to stop off and have a drink somewhere

i d only had three drinks at ernie s and i didn t even finish the last one one thing i have

it s a terrific capacity i can drink all night and not even show it if i m in the mood once

at the whooton school this other boy raymond goldfarb and i bought a pint of scotch

and drank it in the chapel one saturday night where nobody d see us he got stinking but

i hardly didn t even show it i just got very cool and nonchalant i puked before i went to

bed but i didn t really have to i forced myself

anyway before i got to the hotel i started to go in this dumpy looking bar but

two guys came out drunk as hell and wanted to know where the subway was one of

them was this very cuban looking guy and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my

face while i gave him directions i ended up not even going in the damn bar i just went

back to the hotel

the whole lobby was empty it smelled like fifty million dead cigars it really did

i wasn t sleepy or anything but i was feeling sort of lousy depressed and all i almost

wished i was dead

then all of a sudden i got in this big mess

the first thing when i got in the elevator the elevator guy said to me innarested

in having a good time fella or is it too late for you

how do you mean i said i didn t know what he was driving at or anything

innarested in a little tail t night

me i said which was a very dumb answer but it s quite embarrassing when

somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that

how old are you chief the elevator guy said

why i said twenty two

uh huh well how bout it y innarested five bucks a throw fifteen bucks the

whole night he looked at his wrist watch till noon five bucks a throw fifteen bucks

till noon

okay i said it was against my principles and all but i was feeling so depressed

i didn t even think that s the whole trouble when you re feeling very depressed you

can t even think

okay what a throw or till noon i gotta know

just a throw

okay what room ya in

i looked at the red thing with my number on it on my key twelve twenty two

i said i was already sort of sorry i d let the thing start rolling but it was too late now

okay i ll send a girl up in about fifteen minutes he opened the doors and i got

out

hey is she good looking i asked him i don t want any old bag

no old bag don t worry about it chief

who do i pay

her he said let s go chief he shut the doors practically right in my face

i went to my room and put some water on my hair but you can t really comb a

crew cut or anything then i tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and

the scotch and sodas i drank at ernie s all you do is hold your hand under your mouth

and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils it didn t seem to stink much but i

brushed my teeth anyway then i put on another clean shirt i knew i didn t have to get

all dolled up for a prostitute or anything but it sort of gave me something to do i was a

little nervous i was starting to feel pretty sexy and all but i was a little nervous anyway

if you want to know the truth i m a virgin i really am i ve had quite a few opportunities

to lose my virginity and all but i ve never got around to it yet something always

happens for instance if you re at a girl s house her parents always come home at the

wrong time or you re afraid they will or if you re in the back seat of somebody s car

there s always somebody s date in the front seat some girl i mean that always wants to

know what s going on all over the whole goddam car i mean some girl in front keeps

turning around to see what the hell s going on anyway something always happens i

came quite close to doing it a couple of times though one time in particular i

remember something went wrong though i don t even remember what any more the

thing is most of the time when you re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl a girl

that isn t a prostitute or anything i mean she keeps telling you to stop the trouble with

me is i stop most guys don t i can t help it you never know whether they really want

you to stop or whether they re just scared as hell or whether they re just telling you to

stop so that if you do go through with it the blame ll be on you not them anyway i

keep stopping the trouble is i get to feeling sorry for them i mean most girls are so

dumb and all after you neck them for a while you can really watch them losing their

brains you take a girl when she really gets passionate she just hasn t any brains i don t

know they tell me to stop so i stop i always wish i hadn t after i take them home but i

keep doing it anyway

anyway while i was putting on another clean shirt i sort of figured this was my

big chance in a way i figured if she was a prostitute and all i could get in some practice

on her in case i ever get married or anything i worry about that stuff sometimes i read

this book once at the whooton school that had this very sophisticated suave sexy guy

in it monsieur blanchard was his name i can still remember it was a lousy book but

this blanchard guy was pretty good he had this big château and all on the riviera in

europe and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club he was a real

rake and all but he knocked women out he said in this one part that a woman s body is

like a violin and all and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right it was a very

corny book i realize that but i couldn t get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway in a

way that s why i sort of wanted to get some practice in in case i ever get married

caulfield and his magic violin boy it s corny i realize but it isn t too corny i wouldn t

mind being pretty good at that stuff half the time if you really want to know the truth

when i m horsing around with a girl i have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what i m

looking for for god s sake if you know what i mean take this girl that i just missed

having sexual intercourse with that i told you about it took me about an hour to just get

her goddam brassiere off by the time i did get it off she was about ready to spit in my

eye

anyway i kept walking around the room waiting for this prostitute to show up i

kept hoping she d be good looking i didn t care too much though i sort of just wanted to

get it over with finally somebody knocked on the door and when i went to open it i

had my suitcase right in the way and i fell over it and damn near broke my knee i always

pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something

when i opened the door this prostitute was standing there she had a polo coat

on and no hat she was sort of a blonde but you could tell she dyed her hair she wasn t

any old bag though how do you do i said suave as hell boy

you the guy maurice said she asked me she didn t seem too goddam friendly

is he the elevator boy

yeah she said

yes i am come in won t you i said i was getting more and more nonchalant

as it went along i really was

she came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed

she had on a green dress underneath then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair

that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down she

crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down she was very nervous for

a prostitute she really was i think it was because she was young as hell she was around

my age i sat down in the big chair next to her and offered her a cigarette i don t

smoke she said she had a tiny little wheeny whiny voice you could hardly hear her

she never said thank you either when you offered her something she just didn t know

any better

allow me to introduce myself my name is jim steele i said

ya got a watch on ya she said she didn t care what the hell my name was

naturally hey how old are you anyways

me twenty two

like fun you are

it was a funny thing to say it sounded like a real kid you d think a prostitute and

all would say like hell you are or cut the crap instead of like fun you are

how old are you i asked her

old enough to know better she said she was really witty ya got a watch on

ya she asked me again and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head

i certainly felt peculiar when she did that i mean she did it so sudden and all i

know you re supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress

over their head but i didn t sexy was about the last thing i was feeling i felt much more

depressed than sexy

ya got a watch on ya hey

no no i don t i said boy was i feeling peculiar what s your name i asked

her all she had on was this pink slip it was really quite embarrassing it really was

sunny she said let s go hey

don t you feel like talking for a while i asked her it was a childish thing to

say but i was feeling so damn peculiar are you in a very big hurry

she looked at me like i was a madman what the heck ya wanna talk about she

said

i don t know nothing special i just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a

while

she sat down in the chair next to the desk again she didn t like it though you

could tell she started jiggling her foot again boy she was a nervous girl

would you care for a cigarette now i said i forgot she didn t smoke

i don t smoke listen if you re gonna talk do it i got things to do

i couldn t think of anything to talk about though i thought of asking her how she

got to be a prostitute and all but i was scared to ask her she probably wouldn t ve told

me anyway

you don t come from new york do you i said finally that s all i could think

of

hollywood she said then she got up and went over to where she d put her

dress down on the bed ya got a hanger i don t want to get my dress all wrinkly it s

brand clean

sure i said right away i was only too glad to get up and do something i took

her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her it was funny it made me feel sort of

sad when i hung it up i thought of her going in a store and buying it and nobody in the

store knowing she was a prostitute and all the salesman probably just thought she was a

regular girl when she bought it it made me feel sad as hell i don t know why exactly

i sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going she was a lousy

conversationalist do you work every night i asked her it sounded sort of awful after

i d said it

yeah she was walking all around the room she picked up the menu off the

desk and read it

what do you do during the day

she sort of shrugged her shoulders she was pretty skinny sleep go to the

show she put down the menu and looked at me let s go hey i haven t got all

look i said i don t feel very much like myself tonight i ve had a rough night

honest to god i ll pay you and all but do you mind very much if we don t do it do you

mind very much the trouble was i just didn t want to do it i felt more depressed than

sexy if you want to know the truth she was depressing her green dress hanging in the

closet and all and besides i don t think i could ever do it with somebody that sits in a

stupid movie all day long i really don t think i could

she came over to me with this funny look on her face like as if she didn t believe

me what sa matter she said

nothing s the matter boy was i getting nervous the thing is i had an

operation very recently

yeah where

on my wuddayacallit my clavichord

yeah where the hell s that

the clavichord i said well actually it s in the spinal canal i mean it s quite a

ways down in the spinal canal

yeah she said that s tough then she sat down on my goddam lap you re

cute

she made me so nervous i just kept on lying my head off i m still recuperating

i told her

you look like a guy in the movies you know whosis you know who i mean

what the heck s his name

i don t know i said she wouldn t get off my goddam lap

sure you know he was in that pitcher with mel vine douglas the one that was

mel vine douglas s kid brother that falls off this boat you know who i mean

no i don t i go to the movies as seldom as i can

then she started getting funny crude and all

do you mind cutting it out i said i m not in the mood i just told you i just

had an operation

she didn t get up from my lap or anything but she gave me this terrifically dirty

look listen she said i was sleepin when that crazy maurice woke me up if you

think i m

i said i d pay you for coming and all i really will i have plenty of dough it s

just that i m practically just recovering from a very serious

what the heck did you tell that crazy maurice you wanted a girl for then if you

just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit huh

i thought i d be feeling a lot better than i do i was a little premature in my

calculations no kidding i m sorry if you ll just get up a second i ll get my wallet i

mean it

she was sore as hell but she got up off my goddam lap so that i could go over and

get my wallet off the chiffonier i took out a five dollar bill and handed it to her thanks

a lot i told her thanks a million

this is a five it costs ten

she was getting funny you could tell i was afraid something like that would

happen i really was

maurice said five i told her he said fifteen till noon and only five for a

throw

ten for a throw

he said five i m sorry i really am but that s all i m gonna shell out

she sort of shrugged her shoulders the way she did before and then she said

very cold do you mind getting me my frock or would it be too much trouble she

was a pretty spooky kid even with that little bitty voice she had she could sort of scare

you a little bit if she d been a big old prostitute with a lot of makeup on her face and all

she wouldn t have been half as spooky

i went and got her dress for her she put it on and all and then she picked up her

polo coat off the bed so long crumb bum she said

so long i said i didn t thank her or anything i m glad i didn t

14

after old sunny was gone i sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of

cigarettes it was getting daylight outside boy i felt miserable i felt so depressed you

can t imagine what i did i started talking sort of out loud to allie i do that sometimes

when i get very depressed i keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in

front of bobby fallon s house bobby fallon used to live quite near us in maine this is

years ago anyway what happened was one day bobby and i were going over to lake

sedebego on our bikes we were going to take our lunches and all and our bb guns we

were kids and all and we thought we could shoot something with our bb guns anyway

allie heard us talking about it and he wanted to go and i wouldn t let him i told him he

was a child so once in a while now when i get very depressed i keep saying to him

okay go home and get your bike and meet me in front of bobby s house hurry up it

wasn t that i didn t use to take him with me when i went somewhere i did but that one

day i didn t he didn t get sore about it he never got sore about anything but i keep

thinking about it anyway when i get very depressed

finally though i got undressed and got in bed i felt like praying or something

when i was in bed but i couldn t do it i can t always pray when i feel like it in the first

place i m sort of an atheist i like jesus and all but i don t care too much for most of the

other stuff in the bible take the disciples for instance they annoy the hell out of me if

you want to know the truth they were all right after jesus was dead and all but while he

was alive they were about as much use to him as a hole in the head all they did was

keep letting him down i like almost anybody in the bible better than the disciples if

you want to know the truth the guy i like best in the bible next to jesus was that lunatic

and all that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones i like him ten times

as much as the disciples that poor bastard i used to get in quite a few arguments about

it when i was at whooton school with this boy that lived down the corridor arthur

childs old childs was a quaker and all and he read the bible all the time he was a

very nice kid and i liked him but i could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff

in the bible especially the disciples he kept telling me if i didn t like the disciples then

i didn t like jesus and all he said that because jesus picked the disciples you were

supposed to like them i said i knew he picked them but that he picked them at random

i said he didn t have time to go around analyzing everybody i said i wasn t blaming

jesus or anything it wasn t his fault that he didn t have any time i remember i asked old

childs if he thought judas the one that betrayed jesus and all went to hell after he

committed suicide childs said certainly that s exactly where i disagreed with him i

said i d bet a thousand bucks that jesus never sent old judas to hell i still would too if i

had a thousand bucks i think any one of the disciples would ve sent him to hell and all

and fast too but i ll bet anything jesus didn t do it old childs said the trouble with me

was that i didn t go to church or anything he was right about that in a way i don t in

the first place my parents are different religions and all the children in our family are

atheists if you want to know the truth i can t even stand ministers the ones they ve had

at every school i ve gone to they all have these holy joe voices when they start giving

their sermons god i hate that i don t see why the hell they can t talk in their natural

voice they sound so phony when they talk

anyway when i was in bed i couldn t pray worth a damn every time i got

started i kept picturing old sunny calling me a crumb bum finally i sat up in bed and

smoked another cigarette it tasted lousy i must ve smoked around two packs since i left

pencey

all of a sudden while i was laying there smoking somebody knocked on the

door i kept hoping it wasn t my door they were knocking on but i knew damn well it

was i don t know how i knew but i knew i knew who it was too i m psychic

who s there i said i was pretty scared i m very yellow about those things

they just knocked again though louder

finally i got out of bed with just my pajamas on and opened the door i didn t

even have to turn the light on in the room because it was already daylight old sunny

and maurice the pimpy elevator guy were standing there

what s the matter wuddaya want i said boy my voice was shaking like hell

nothin much old maurice said just five bucks he did all the talking for the

two of them old sunny just stood there next to him with her mouth open and all

i paid her already i gave her five bucks ask her i said boy was my voice

shaking

it s ten bucks chief i tole ya that ten bucks for a throw fifteen bucks till noon

i tole ya that

you did not tell me that you said five bucks a throw you said fifteen bucks till

noon all right but i distinctly heard you

open up chief

what for i said god my old heart was damn near beating me out of the room

i wished i was dressed at least it s terrible to be just in your pajamas when something

like that happens

let s go chief old maurice said then he gave me a big shove with his crumby

hand i damn near fell over on my can he was a huge sonuvabitch the next thing i

knew he and old sunny were both in the room they acted like they owned the damn

place old sunny sat down on the window sill old maurice sat down in the big chair and

loosened his collar and all he was wearing this elevator operator s uniform boy was i

nervous

all right chief let s have it i gotta get back to work

i told you about ten times i don t owe you a cent i already gave her the five

cut the crap now let s have it

why should i give her another five bucks i said my voice was cracking all

over the place you re trying to chisel me

old maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat all he had on underneath was a

phony shirt collar but no shirt or anything he had a big fat hairy stomach nobody s

tryna chisel nobody he said let s have it chief

no

when i said that he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and all

he looked like he was very very tired or very very bored god was i scared i sort of

had my arms folded i remember it wouldn t have been so bad i don t think if i hadn t

had just my goddam pajamas on

let s have it chief he came right up to where i was standing that s all he

could say let s have it chief he was a real moron

no

chief you re gonna force me inna roughin ya up a little bit i don t wanna do it

but that s the way it looks he said you owe us five bucks

i don t owe you five bucks i said if you rough me up i ll yell like hell i ll

wake up everybody in the hotel the police and all my voice was shaking like a bastard

go ahead yell your goddam head off fine old maurice said want your

parents to know you spent the night with a whore high class kid like you he was

pretty sharp in his crumby way he really was

leave me alone if you d said ten it d be different but you distinctly

are ya gonna let us have it he had me right up against the damn door he was

almost standing on top of me his crumby old hairy stomach and all

leave me alone get the hell out of my room i said i still had my arms folded

and all god what a jerk i was

then sunny said something for the first time hey maurice want me to get his

wallet she said it s right on the wutchamacallit

yeah get it

leave my wallet alone

i awreddy got it sunny said she waved five bucks at me see all i m takin is

the five you owe me i m no crook

all of a sudden i started to cry i d give anything if i hadn t but i did no you re

no crooks i said you re just stealing five

shut up old maurice said and gave me a shove

leave him alone hey sunny said c mon hey we got the dough he owes us

let s go c mon hey

i mean it maurice hey leave him alone

who s hurtin anybody he said innocent as hell then what he did he snapped

his finger very hard on my pajamas i won t tell you where he snapped it but it hurt like

hell i told him he was a goddam dirty moron what s that he said he put his hand

behind his ear like a deaf guy what s that what am i

i was still sort of crying i was so damn mad and nervous and all you re a dirty

moron i said you re a stupid chiseling moron and in about two years you ll be one of

those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for coffee you ll

have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat and you ll be

then he smacked me i didn t even try to get out of the way or duck or anything

all i felt was this terrific punch in my stomach

i wasn t knocked out or anything though because i remember looking up from

the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it then i stayed on the floor a

fairly long time sort of the way i did with stradlater only this time i thought i was

dying i really did i thought i was drowning or something the trouble was i could

hardly breathe when i did finally get up i had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up

and holding onto my stomach and all

but i m crazy i swear to god i am about halfway to the bathroom i sort of

started pretending i had a bullet in my guts old maurice had plugged me now i was on

the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves

and help me really go into action i pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom

dressed and all with my automatic in my pocket and staggering around a little bit then

i d walk downstairs instead of using the elevator i d hold onto the banister and all with

this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time what i d do i d walk

down a few floors holding onto my guts blood leaking all over the place and then i d

ring the elevator bell as soon as old maurice opened the doors he d see me with the

automatic in my hand and he d start screaming at me in this very high pitched yellow

belly voice to leave him alone but i d plug him anyway six shots right through his fat

hairy belly then i d throw my automatic down the elevator shaft after i d wiped off all

the finger prints and all then i d crawl back to my room and call up jane and have her

come over and bandage up my guts i pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke

while i was bleeding and all

the goddam movies they can ruin you i m not kidding

i stayed in the bathroom for about an hour taking a bath and all then i got back

in bed it took me quite a while to get to sleep i wasn t even tired but finally i did what

i really felt like though was committing suicide i felt like jumping out the window i

probably would ve done it too if i d been sure somebody d cover me up as soon as i

landed i didn t want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when i was all gory

15

i didn t sleep too long because i think it was only around ten o clock when i woke

up i felt pretty hungry as soon as i had a cigarette the last time i d eaten was those two

hamburgers i had with brossard and ackley when we went in to agerstown to the

movies that was a long time ago it seemed like fifty years ago the phone was right

next to me and i started to call down and have them send up some breakfast but i was

sort of afraid they might send it up with old maurice if you think i was dying to see him

again you re crazy so i just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette

i thought of giving old jane a buzz to see if she was home yet and all but i wasn t in the

mood

what i did do i gave old sally hayes a buzz she went to mary a woodruff and

i knew she was home because i d had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago i wasn t

too crazy about her but i d known her for years i used to think she was quite intelligent

in my stupidity the reason i did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and

plays and literature and all that stuff if somebody knows quite a lot about those things it

takes you quite a while to find out whether they re really stupid or not it took me years to

find it out in old sally s case i think i d have found it out a lot sooner if we hadn t necked

so damn much my big trouble is i always sort of think whoever i m necking is a pretty

intelligent person it hasn t got a goddam thing to do with it but i keep thinking it

anyway

anyway i gave her a buzz first the maid answered then her father then she

got on sally i said

yes who is this she said she was quite a little phony i d already told her

father who it was

holden caulfield how are ya

holden i m fine how are you

swell listen how are ya anyway i mean how s school

fine she said i mean you know

swell well listen i was wondering if you were busy today it s sunday but

there s always one or two matinees going on sunday benefits and that stuff would you

care to go

i d love to grand

grand if there s one word i hate it s grand it s so phony for a second i was

tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee but we chewed the fat for a while that is

she chewed it you couldn t get a word in edgewise first she told me about some

harvard guy it probably was a freshman but she didn t say naturally that was rushing

hell out of her calling her up night and day night and day that killed me then she told

me about some other guy some west point cadet that was cutting his throat over her too

big deal i told her to meet me under the clock at the biltmore at two o clock and not to

be late because the show probably started at two thirty she was always late then i hung

up she gave me a pain in the ass but she was very good looking

after i made the date with old sally i got out of bed and got dressed and packed

my bag i took a look out the window before i left the room though to see how all the

perverts were doing but they all had their shades down they were the heighth of

modesty in the morning then i went down in the elevator and checked out i didn t see

old maurice around anywhere i didn t break my neck looking for him naturally the

bastard

i got a cab outside the hotel but i didn t have the faintest damn idea where i was

going i had no place to go it was only sunday and i couldn t go home till wednesday

or tuesday the soonest and i certainly didn t feel like going to another hotel and getting

my brains beat out so what i did i told the driver to take me to grand central station it

was right near the biltmore where i was meeting sally later and i figured what i d do i d

check my bags in one of those strong boxes that they give you a key to then get some

breakfast i was sort of hungry while i was in the cab i took out my wallet and sort of

counted my money i don t remember exactly what i had left but it was no fortune or

anything i d spent a king s ransom in about two lousy weeks i really had i m a goddam

spendthrift at heart what i don t spend i lose half the time i sort of even forget to pick

up my change at restaurants and night clubs and all it drives my parents crazy you can t

blame them my father s quite wealthy though i don t know how much he makes he s

never discussed that stuff with me but i imagine quite a lot he s a corporation lawyer

those boys really haul it in another reason i know he s quite well off he s always

investing money in shows on broadway they always flop though and it drives my

mother crazy when he does it she hasn t felt too healthy since my brother allie died

she s very nervous that s another reason why i hated like hell for her to know i got the

ax again

after i put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station i went into this

little sandwich bar and bad breakfast i had quite a large breakfast for me orange juice

bacon and eggs toast and coffee usually i just drink some orange juice i m a very light

eater i really am that s why i m so damn skinny i was supposed to be on this diet where

you eat a lot of starches and crap to gain weight and all but i didn t ever do it when i m

out somewhere i generally just eat a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk it isn t

much but you get quite a lot of vitamins in the malted milk h v caulfield holden

vitamin caulfield

while i was eating my eggs these two nuns with suitcases and all i guessed they

were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a train came in and

sat down next to me at the counter they didn t seem to know what the hell to do with

their suitcases so i gave them a hand they were these very inexpensive looking

suitcases the ones that aren t genuine leather or anything it isn t important i know but i

hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases it sounds terrible to say it but i can even get

to hate somebody just looking at them if they have cheap suitcases with them

something happened once for a while when i was at elkton hills i roomed with this

boy dick slagle that had these very inexpensive suitcases he used to keep them under

the bed instead of on the rack so that nobody d see them standing next to mine it

depressed holy hell out of me and i kept wanting to throw mine out or something or

even trade with him mine came from mark cross and they were genuine cowhide and

all that crap and i guess they cost quite a pretty penny but it was a funny thing here s

what happened what i did i finally put my suitcases under my bed instead of on the

rack so that old slagle wouldn t get a goddam inferiority complex about it but here s

what he did the day after i put mine under my bed he took them out and put them back

on the rack the reason he did it it took me a while to find out was because he wanted

people to think my bags were his he really did he was a very funny guy that way he

was always saying snotty things about them my suitcases for instance he kept saying

they were too new and bourgeois that was his favorite goddam word he read it

somewhere or heard it somewhere everything i had was bourgeois as hell even my

fountain pen was bourgeois he borrowed it off me all the time but it was bourgeois

anyway we only roomed together about two months then we both asked to be moved

and the funny thing was i sort of missed him after we moved because he had a helluva

good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes i wouldn t be surprised if he

missed me too at first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois

and i didn t give a damn it was sort of funny in fact then after a while you could tell

he wasn t kidding any more the thing is it s really hard to be roommates with people if

your suitcases are much better than theirs if yours are really good ones and theirs aren t

you think if they re intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor

that they don t give a damn whose suitcases are better but they do they really do it s

one of the reasons why i roomed with a stupid bastard like stradlater at least his

suitcases were as good as mine

anyway these two nuns were sitting next to me and we sort of struck up a

conversation the one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns

and salvation army babes collecting dough with around christmas time you see them

standing on corners especially on fifth avenue in front of the big department stores and

all anyway the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and i reached down and picked

it up for her i asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all she said no

she said she couldn t get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just

carrying it she had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you she had a big nose and

she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that aren t too attractive but she had a

helluva kind face i thought if you were taking up a collection i told her i could make

a small contribution you could keep the money for when you do take up a collection

oh how very kind of you she said and the other one her friend looked over at

me the other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee it looked

like a bible but it was too skinny it was a bible type book though all the two of them

were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee that depressed me i hate it if i m eating

bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee

they let me give them ten bucks as a contribution they kept asking me if i was

sure i could afford it and all i told them i had quite a bit of money with me but they

didn t seem to believe me they took it though finally the both of them kept thanking

me so much it was embarrassing i swung the conversation around to general topics and

asked them where they were going they said they were schoolteachers and that they d

just come from chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on

168th street or 186th street or one of those streets way the hell uptown the one next to

me with the iron glasses said she taught english and her friend taught history and

american government then i started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next

to me that taught english thought about being a nun and all when she read certain

books for english books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them but books with

lovers and all in them take old eustacia vye in the return of the native by thomas

hardy she wasn t too sexy or anything but even so you can t help wondering what a nun

maybe thinks about when she reads about old eustacia i didn t say anything though

naturally all i said was english was my best subject

oh really oh i m so glad the one with the glasses that taught english said

what have you read this year i d be very interested to know she was really nice

well most of the time we were on the anglo saxons beowulf and old grendel

and lord randal my son and all those things but we had to read outside books for extra

credit once in a while i read the return of the native by thomas hardy and romeo and

juliet and julius

oh romeo and juliet lovely didn t you just love it she certainly didn t

sound much like a nun

yes i did i liked it a lot there were a few things i didn t like about it but it was

quite moving on the whole

what didn t you like about it can you remember to tell you the truth it was

sort of embarrassing in a way to be talking about romeo and juliet with her i mean that

play gets pretty sexy in some parts and she was a nun and all but she asked me so i

discussed it with her for a while well i m not too crazy about romeo and juliet i said

i mean i like them but i don t know they get pretty annoying sometimes i mean i felt

much sorrier when old mercutio got killed than when romeo and juliet did the think is

i never liked romeo too much after mercutio gets stabbed by that other man juliet s

cousin what s his name

tybalt

that s right tybalt i said i always forget that guy s name it was romeo s

fault i mean i liked him the best in the play old mercutio i don t know all those

montagues and capulets they re all right especially juliet but mercutio he was it s

hard to explain he was very smart and entertaining and all the thing is it drives me

crazy if somebody gets killed especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all

and it s somebody else s fault romeo and juliet at least it was their own fault

what school do you go to she asked me she probably wanted to get off the

subject of romeo and juliet

i told her pencey and she d heard of it she said it was a very good school i let it

pass though then the other one the one that taught history and government said they d

better be running along i took their check off them but they wouldn t let me pay it the

one with the glasses made me give it back to her

you ve been more than generous she said you re a very sweet boy she

certainly was nice she reminded me a little bit of old ernest morrow s mother the one i

met on the train when she smiled mostly we ve enjoyed talking to you so much she

said

i said i d enjoyed talking to them a lot too i meant it too i d have enjoyed it

even more though i think if i hadn t been sort of afraid the whole time i was talking to

them that they d all of a sudden try to find out if i was a catholic catholics are always

trying to find out if you re a catholic it happens to me a lot i know partly because my

last name is irish and most people of irish descent are catholics as a matter of fact my

father was a catholic once he quit though when he married my mother but catholics

are always trying to find out if you re a catholic even if they don t know your last name i

knew this one catholic boy louis shaney when i was at the whooton school he was

the first boy i ever met there he and i were sitting in the first two chairs outside the

goddam infirmary the day school opened waiting for our physicals and we sort of

struck up this conversation about tennis he was quite interested in tennis and so was i

he told me he went to the nationals at forest hills every summer and i told him i did

too and then we talked about certain hot shot tennis players for quite a while he knew

quite a lot about tennis for a kid his age he really did then after a while right in the

middle of the goddam conversation he asked me did you happen to notice where the

catholic church is in town by any chance the thing was you could tell by the way he

asked me that he was trying to find out if i was a catholic he really was not that he was

prejudiced or anything but he just wanted to know he was enjoying the conversation

about tennis and all but you could tell he would ve enjoyed it more if i was a catholic

and all that kind of stuff drives me crazy i m not saying it ruined our conversation or

anything it didn t but it sure as hell didn t do it any good that s why i was glad those

two nuns didn t ask me if i was a catholic it wouldn t have spoiled the conversation if

they had but it would ve been different probably i m not saying i blame catholics i

don t i d be the same way probably if i was a catholic it s just like those suitcases i was

telling you about in a way all i m saying is that it s no good for a nice conversation

that s all i m saying

when they got up to go the two nuns i did something very stupid and

embarrassing i was smoking a cigarette and when i stood up to say good by to them by

mistake i blew some smoke in their face i didn t mean to but i did it i apologized like a

madman and they were very polite and nice about it but it was very embarrassing

anyway

after they left i started getting sorry that i d only given them ten bucks for their

collection but the thing was i d made that date to go to a matinee with old sally hayes

and i needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff i was sorry anyway though

goddam money it always ends up making you blue as hell

16

after i had my breakfast it was only around noon and i wasn t meeting old sally

till two o clock so i started taking this long walk i couldn t stop thinking about those two

nuns i kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went around collecting

money with when they weren t teaching school i kept trying to picture my mother or

somebody or my aunt or sally hayes s crazy mother standing outside some department

store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat up old straw basket it was hard to

picture not so much my mother but those other two my aunt s pretty charitable she

does a lot of red cross work and all but she s very well dressed and all and when she

does anything charitable she s always very well dressed and has lipstick on and all that

crap i couldn t picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and

no lipstick while she was doing it and old sally hayes s mother jesus christ the only

way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed

her ass for her when they made a contribution if they just dropped their dough in her

basket then walked away without saying anything to her ignoring her and all she d quit

in about an hour she d get bored she d hand in her basket and then go someplace

swanky for lunch that s what i liked about those nuns you could tell for one thing that

they never went anywhere swanky for lunch it made me so damn sad when i thought

about it their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything i knew it wasn t too

important but it made me sad anyway

i started walking over toward broadway just for the hell of it because i hadn t

been over there in years besides i wanted to find a record store that was open on

sunday there was this record i wanted to get for phoebe called little shirley beans

it was a very hard record to get it was about a little kid that wouldn t go out of the house

because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to i heard it at pencey a

boy that lived on the next floor had it and i tried to buy it off him because i knew it

would knock old phoebe out but he wouldn t sell it it was a very old terrific record that

this colored girl singer estelle fletcher made about twenty years ago she sings it very

dixieland and whorehouse and it doesn t sound at all mushy if a white girl was singing

it she d make it sound cute as hell but old estelle fletcher knew what the hell she was

doing and it was one of the best records i ever heard i figured i d buy it in some store

that was open on sunday and then i d take it up to the park with me it was sunday and

phoebe goes rollerskating in the park on sundays quite frequently i knew where she

hung out mostly

it wasn t as cold as it was the day before but the sun still wasn t out and it wasn t

too nice for walking but there was one nice thing this family that you could tell just

came out of some church were walking right in front of me a father a mother and a

little kid about six years old they looked sort of poor the father had on one of those

pearl gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp he and his wife

were just walking along talking not paying any attention to their kid the kid was swell

he was walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk but right next to the curb he

was making out like he was walking a very straight line the way kids do and the whole

time he kept singing and humming i got up closer so i could hear what he was singing

he was singing that song if a body catch a body coming through the rye he had a

pretty little voice too he was just singing for the hell of it you could tell the cars

zoomed by brakes screeched all over the place his parents paid no attention to him and

he kept on walking next to the curb and singing if a body catch a body coming through

the rye it made me feel better it made me feel not so depressed any more

broadway was mobbed and messy it was sunday and only about twelve o clock

but it was mobbed anyway everybody was on their way to the movies the paramount or

the astor or the strand or the capitol or one of those crazy places everybody was all

dressed up because it was sunday and that made it worse but the worst part was that

you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies i couldn t stand looking at them i can

understand somebody going to the movies because there s nothing else to do but when

somebody really wants to go and even walks fast so as to get there quicker then it

depresses hell out of me especially if i see millions of people standing in one of those

long terrible lines all the way down the block waiting with this terrific patience for seats

and all boy i couldn t get off that goddam broadway fast enough i was lucky the first

record store i went into had a copy of little shirley beans they charged me five bucks

for it because it was so hard to get but i didn t care boy it made me so happy all of a

sudden i could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old phoebe was around so that i

could give it to her

when i came out of the record store i passed this drugstore and i went in i

figured maybe i d give old jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet so i

went in a phone booth and called her up the only trouble was her mother answered the

phone so i had to hang up i didn t feel like getting involved in a long conversation and

all with her i m not crazy about talking to girls mothers on the phone anyway i

should ve at least asked her if jane was home yet though it wouldn t have killed me but

i didn t feel like it you really have to be in the mood for that stuff

i still had to get those damn theater tickets so i bought a paper and looked up to

see what shows were playing on account of it was sunday there were only about three

shows playing so what i did was i went over and bought two orchestra seats for i know

my love it was a benefit performance or something i didn t much want to see it but i

knew old sally the queen of the phonies would start drooling all over the place when i

told her i had tickets for that because the lunts were in it and all she liked shows that

are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all with the lunts and all i don t i

don t like any shows very much if you want to know the truth they re not as bad as

movies but they re certainly nothing to rave about in the first place i hate actors they

never act like people they just think they do some of the good ones do in a very slight

way but not in a way that s fun to watch and if any actor s really good you can always

tell he knows he s good and that spoils it you take sir laurence olivier for example i

saw him in hamlet d b took phoebe and i to see it last year he treated us to lunch first

and then he took us he d already seen it and the way he talked about it at lunch i was

anxious as hell to see it too but i didn t enjoy it much i just don t see what s so

marvelous about sir laurence olivier that s all he has a terrific voice and he s a helluva

handsome guy and he s very nice to watch when he s walking or dueling or something

but he wasn t at all the way d b said hamlet was he was too much like a goddam

general instead of a sad screwed up type guy the best part in the whole picture was

when old ophelia s brother the one that gets in the duel with hamlet at the very end

was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice while the father kept

giving him a lot of advice old ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother

taking his dagger out of the holster and teasing him and all while he was trying to look

interested in the bull his father was shooting that was nice i got a big bang out of that

but you don t see that kind of stuff much the only thing old phoebe liked was when

hamlet patted this dog on the head she thought that was funny and nice and it was

what i ll have to do is i ll have to read that play the trouble with me is i always have to

read that stuff by myself if an actor acts it out i hardly listen i keep worrying about

whether he s going to do something phony every minute

after i got the tickets to the lunts show i took a cab up to the park i should ve

taken a subway or something because i was getting slightly low on dough but i wanted

to get off that damn broadway as fast as i could

it was lousy in the park it wasn t too cold but the sun still wasn t out and there

didn t look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar

butts from old men and the benches all looked like they d be wet if you sat down on

them it made you depressed and every once in a while for no reason you got goose

flesh while you walked it didn t seem at all like christmas was coming soon it didn t

seem like anything was coming but i kept walking over to the mall anyway because

that s where phoebe usually goes when she s in the park she likes to skate near the

bandstand it s funny that s the same place i used to like to skate when i was a kid

when i got there though i didn t see her around anywhere there were a few kids

around skating and all and two boys were playing flys up with a soft ball but no

phoebe i saw one kid about her age though sitting on a bench all by herself tightening

her skate i thought maybe she might know phoebe and could tell me where she was or

something so i went over and sat down next to her and asked her do you know phoebe

caulfield by any chance

who she said all she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters you could

tell her mother made them for her because they were lumpy as hell

phoebe caulfield she lives on seventy first street she s in the fourth grade

over at

you know phoebe

yeah i m her brother you know where she is

she s in miss callon s class isn t she the kid said

i don t know yes i think she is

she s prob ly in the museum then we went last saturday the kid said

which museum i asked her

she shrugged her shoulders sort of i don t know she said the museum

i know but the one where the pictures are or the one where the indians are

the one where the indians

thanks a lot i said i got up and started to go but then i suddenly remembered

it was sunday this is sunday i told the kid

she looked up at me oh then she isn t

she was having a helluva time tightening her skate she didn t have any gloves on

or anything and her hands were all red and cold i gave her a hand with it boy i hadn t

had a skate key in my hand for years it didn t feel funny though you could put a skate

key in my hand fifty years from now in pitch dark and i d still know what it is she

thanked me and all when i had it tightened for her she was a very nice polite little kid

god i love it when a kid s nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or

something most kids are they really are i asked her if she d care to have a hot

chocolate or something with me but she said no thank you she said she had to meet her

friend kids always have to meet their friend that kills me

even though it was sunday and phoebe wouldn t be there with her class or

anything and even though it was so damp and lousy out i walked all the way through the

park over to the museum of natural history i knew that was the museum the kid with

the skate key meant i knew that whole museum routine like a book phoebe went to the

same school i went to when i was a kid and we used to go there all the time we had this

teacher miss aigletinger that took us there damn near every saturday sometimes we

looked at the animals and sometimes we looked at the stuff the indians had made in

ancient times pottery and straw baskets and all stuff like that i get very happy when i

think about it even now i remember after we looked at all the indian stuff usually we

went to see some movie in this big auditorium columbus they were always showing

columbus discovering america having one helluva time getting old ferdinand and

isabella to lend him the dough to buy ships with and then the sailors mutinying on him

and all nobody gave too much of a damn about old columbus but you always had a lot

of candy and gum and stuff with you and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice

smell it always smelled like it was raining outside even if it wasn t and you were in the

only nice dry cosy place in the world i loved that damn museum i remember you had

to go through the indian room to get to the auditorium it was a long long room and you

were only supposed to whisper the teacher would go first then the class you d be two

rows of kids and you d have a partner most of the time my partner was this girl named

gertrude levine she always wanted to hold your hand and her hand was always sticky

or sweaty or something the floor was all stone and if you had some marbles in your

hand and you dropped them they bounced like madmen all over the floor and made a

helluva racket and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell

was going on she never got sore though miss aigletinger then you d pass by this long

long indian war canoe about as long as three goddam cadillacs in a row with about

twenty indians in it some of them paddling some of them just standing around looking

tough and they all had war paint all over their faces there was one very spooky guy in

the back of the canoe with a mask on he was the witch doctor he gave me the creeps

but i liked him anyway another thing if you touched one of the paddles or anything

while you were passing one of the guards would say to you don t touch anything

children but he always said it in a nice voice not like a goddam cop or anything then

you d pass by this big glass case with indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a

fire and a squaw weaving a blanket the squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of

bending over and you could see her bosom and all we all used to sneak a good look at

it even the girls because they were only little kids and they didn t have any more bosom

than we did then just before you went inside the auditorium right near the doors you

passed this eskimo he was sitting over a hole in this icy lake and he was fishing

through it he had about two fish right next to the hole that he d already caught boy that

museum was full of glass cases there were even more upstairs with deer inside them

drinking at water holes and birds flying south for the winter the birds nearest you were

all stuffed and hung up on wires and the ones in back were just painted on the wall but

they all looked like they were really flying south and if you bent your head down and

sort of looked at them upside down they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south the

best thing though in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was

nobody d move you could go there a hundred thousand times and that eskimo would

still be just finished catching those two fish the birds would still be on their way south

the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole with their pretty antlers and their

pretty skinny legs and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that

same blanket nobody d be different the only thing that would be different would be

you not that you d be so much older or anything it wouldn t be that exactly you d just

be different that s all you d have an overcoat on this time or the kid that was your

partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you d have a new partner or you d

have a substitute taking the class instead of miss aigletinger or you d heard your

mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom or you d just passed by one of

those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them i mean you d be different in

some way i can t explain what i mean and even if i could i m not sure i d feel like it

i took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while i walked and put it on i knew i

wouldn t meet anybody that knew me and it was pretty damp out i kept walking and

walking and i kept thinking about old phoebe going to that museum on saturdays the

way i used to i thought how she d see the same stuff i used to see and how she d be

different every time she saw it it didn t exactly depress me to think about it but it didn t

make me feel gay as hell either certain things they should stay the way they are you

ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone i

know that s impossible but it s too bad anyway anyway i kept thinking about all that

while i walked

i passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids

on a seesaw one of them was sort of fat and i put my hand on the skinny kid s end to

sort of even up the weight but you could tell they didn t want me around so i let them

alone

then a funny thing happened when i got to the museum all of a sudden i

wouldn t have gone inside for a million bucks it just didn t appeal to me and here i d

walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all if phoebe d been

there i probably would have but she wasn t so all i did in front of the museum was get

a cab and go down to the biltmore i didn t feel much like going i d made that damn date

with sally though

17

i was way early when i got there so i just sat down on one of those leather

couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls a lot of schools were

home for vacation already and there were about a million girls sitting and standing

around waiting for their dates to show up girls with their legs crossed girls with their

legs not crossed girls with terrific legs girls with lousy legs girls that looked like swell

girls girls that looked like they d be bitches if you knew them it was really nice

sightseeing if you know what i mean in a way it was sort of depressing too because

you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them when they got out of

school and college i mean you figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys

guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars

guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf or even just some stupid

game like ping pong guys that are very mean guys that never read books guys that are

very boring but i have to be careful about that i mean about calling certain guys bores i

don t understand boring guys i really don t when i was at elkton hills i roomed for

about two months with this boy harris mackim he was very intelligent and all but he

was one of the biggest bores i ever met he had one of these very raspy voices and he

never stopped talking practically he never stopped talking and what was awful was he

never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place but he could do one thing the

sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody i ever heard he d be making his bed or

hanging up stuff in the closet he was always hanging up stuff in the closet it drove me

crazy and he d be whistling while he did it if he wasn t talking in this raspy voice he

could even whistle classical stuff but most of the time he just whistled jazz he could

take something very jazzy like tin roof blues and whistle it so nice and easy right

while he was hanging stuff up in the closet that it could kill you naturally i never told

him i thought he was a terrific whistler i mean you don t just go up to somebody and say

you re a terrific whistler but i roomed with him for about two whole months even

though he bored me till i was half crazy just because he was such a terrific whistler the

best i ever heard so i don t know about bores maybe you shouldn t feel too sorry if you

see some swell girl getting married to them they don t hurt anybody most of them and

maybe they re secretly all terrific whistlers or something who the hell knows not me

finally old sally started coming up the stairs and i started down to meet her she

looked terrific she really did she had on this black coat and sort of a black beret she

hardly ever wore a hat but that beret looked nice the funny part is i felt like marrying

her the minute i saw her i m crazy i didn t even like her much and yet all of a sudden i

felt like i was in love with her and wanted to marry her i swear to god i m crazy i admit

it

holden she said it s marvelous to see you it s been ages she had one of

these very loud embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere she got away with it

because she was so damn good looking but it always gave me a pain in the ass

swell to see you i said i meant it too how are ya anyway

absolutely marvelous am i late

i told her no but she was around ten minutes late as a matter of fact i didn t give

a damn though all that crap they have in cartoons in the saturday evening post and all

showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are late that s

bunk if a girl looks swell when she meets you who gives a damn if she s late nobody

we better hurry i said the show starts at two forty we started going down the

stairs to where the taxis are

what are we going to see she said

i don t know the lunts it s all i could get tickets for

the lunts oh marvelous i told you she d go mad when she heard it was for

the lunts

we horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater at first she

didn t want to because she had her lipstick on and all but i was being seductive as hell

and she didn t have any alternative twice when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic

i damn near fell off the seat those damn drivers never even look where they re going i

swear they don t then just to show you how crazy i am when we were coming out of

this big clinch i told her i loved her and all it was a lie of course but the thing is i

meant it when i said it i m crazy i swear to god i am

oh darling i love you too she said then right in the same damn breath she

said promise me you ll let your hair grow crew cuts are getting corny and your hair s

so lovely

lovely my ass

the show wasn t as bad as some i ve seen it was on the crappy side though it

was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple it starts out when

they re young and all and the girl s parents don t want her to marry the boy but she

marries him anyway then they keep getting older and older the husband goes to war

and the wife has this brother that s a drunkard i couldn t get very interested i mean i

didn t care too much when anybody in the family died or anything they were all just a

bunch of actors the husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple very witty and all

but i couldn t get too interested in them for one thing they kept drinking tea or some

goddam thing all through the play every time you saw them some butler was shoving

some tea in front of them or the wife was pouring it for somebody and everybody kept

coming in and going out all the time you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand

up alfred lunt and lynn fontanne were the old couple and they were very good but i

didn t like them much they were different though i ll say that they didn t act like

people and they didn t act like actors it s hard to explain they acted more like they knew

they were celebrities and all i mean they were good but they were too good when one

of them got finished making a speech the other one said something very fast right after it

it was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all the

trouble was it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other they acted a

little bit the way old ernie down in the village plays the piano if you do something too

good then after a while if you don t watch it you start showing off and then you re not

as good any more but anyway they were the only ones in the show the lunts i mean

that looked like they had any real brains i have to admit it

at the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette what

a deal that was you never saw so many phonies in all your life everybody smoking their

ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they

were some dopey movie actor was standing near us having a cigarette i don t know his

name but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before it s

time to go over the top he was with some gorgeous blonde and the two of them were

trying to be very blasé and all like as if he didn t even know people were looking at him

modest as hell i got a big bang out of it old sally didn t talk much except to rave about

the lunts because she was busy rubbering and being charming then all of a sudden she

saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby some guy in one of those very

dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests strictly ivy league big deal

he was standing next to the wall smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell

old sally kept saying i know that boy from somewhere she always knew somebody

any place you took her or thought she did she kept saying that till i got bored as hell

and i said to her why don t you go on over and give him a big soul kiss if you know

him he ll enjoy it she got sore when i said that finally though the jerk noticed her

and came over and said hello you should ve seen the way they said hello you d have

thought they hadn t seen each other in twenty years you d have thought they d taken

baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids old buddyroos it was

nauseating the funny part was they probably met each other just once at some phony

party finally when they were all done slobbering around old sally introduced us his

name was george something i don t even remember and he went to andover big big

deal you should ve seen him when old sally asked him how he liked the play he was

the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody s

question he stepped back and stepped right on the lady s foot behind him he probably

broke every toe in her body he said the play itself was no masterpiece but that the

lunts of course were absolute angels angels for chrissake angels that killed me

then he and old sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew it was the

phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life they both kept thinking of places as

fast as they could then they d think of somebody that lived there and mention their name

i was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again i really was and then when

the next act was over they continued their goddam boring conversation they kept

thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there the worst part was

the jerk had one of those very phony ivy league voices one of those very tired snobby

voices he sounded just like a girl he didn t hesitate to horn in on my date the bastard i

even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the

show was over because he walked about two blocks with us but he had to meet a bunch

of phonies for cocktails he said i could see them all sitting around in some bar with

their goddam checkered vests criticizing shows and books and women in those tired

snobby voices they kill me those guys

i sort of hated old sally by the time we got in the cab after listening to that phony

andover bastard for about ten hours i was all set to take her home and all i really was

but she said i have a marvelous idea she was always having a marvelous idea

listen she said what time do you have to be home for dinner i mean are you in a

terrible hurry or anything do you have to be home any special time

me no no special time i said truer word was never spoken boy why

let s go ice skating at radio city

that s the kind of ideas she always had

ice skating at radio city you mean right now

just for an hour or so don t you want to if you don t want to

i didn t say i didn t want to i said sure if you want to

do you mean it don t just say it if you don t mean it i mean i don t give a darn

one way or the other

not much she didn t

you can rent those darling little skating skirts old sally said jeannette cultz

did it last week

that s why she was so hot to go she wanted to see herself in one of those little

skirts that just come down over their butt and all

so we went and after they gave us our skates they gave sally this little blue butt

twitcher of a dress to wear she really did look damn good in it though i save to admit it

and don t think she didn t know it the kept walking ahead of me so that i d see how

cute her little ass looked it did look pretty cute too i have to admit it

the funny part was though we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink

i mean the worst and there were some lulus too old sally s ankles kept bending in till

they were practically on the ice they not only looked stupid as hell but they probably

hurt like hell too i know mine did mine were killing me we must ve looked gorgeous

and what made it worse there were at least a couple of hundred rubbernecks that didn t

have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over

themselves

do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something i said to her

finally

that s the most marvelous idea you ve had all day the said she was killing

herself it was brutal i really felt sorry for her

we took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks

and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet as soon as we sat down old sally took

off her gloves and i gave her a cigarette she wasn t looking too happy the waiter came

up and i ordered a coke for her she didn t drink and a scotch and soda for myself but

the sonuvabitch wouldn t bring me one so i had a coke too then i sort of started

lighting matches i do that quite a lot when i m in a certain mood i sort of let them burn

down till i can t hold them any more then i drop them in the ashtray it s a nervous habit

then all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky old sally said look i have to

know are you or aren t you coming over to help me trim the tree christmas eve i have

to know she was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was skating

i wrote you i would you ve asked me that about twenty times sure i am

i mean i have to know she said she started looking all around the goddam

room

all of a sudden i quit lighting matches and sort of leaned nearer to her over the

table i had quite a few topics on my mind hey sally i said

what she said she was looking at some girl on the other side of the room

did you ever get fed up i said i mean did you ever get scared that everything

was going to go lousy unless you did something i mean do you like school and all that

stuff

it s a terrific bore

i mean do you hate it i know it s a terrific bore but do you hate it is what i

mean

well i don t exactly hate it you always have to

well i hate it boy do i hate it i said but it isn t just that it s everything i

hate living in new york and all taxicabs and madison avenue buses with the drivers

and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door and being introduced to phony

guys that call the lunts angels and going up and down in elevators when you just want to

go outside and guys fitting your pants all the time at brooks and people always

don t shout please old sally said which was very funny because i wasn t

even shouting

take cars i said i said it in this very quiet voice take most people they re

crazy about cars they worry if they get a little scratch on them and they re always

talking about how many miles they get to a gallon and if they get a brand new car

already they start thinking about trading it in for one that s even newer i don t even like

old cars i mean they don t even interest me i d rather have a goddam horse a horse is at

least human for god s sake a horse you can at least

i don t know what you re even talking about old sally said you jump from

one

you know something i said you re probably the only reason i m in new

york right now or anywhere if you weren t around i d probably be someplace way the

hell off in the woods or some goddam place you re the only reason i m around

practically

you re sweet she said but you could tell she wanted me to change the damn

subject

you ought to go to a boys school sometime try it sometime i said it s full of

phonies and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be

able to buy a goddam cadillac some day and you have to keep making believe you give

a damn if the football team loses and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all

day and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques the guys that are

on the basketball team stick together the catholics stick together the goddam

intellectuals stick together the guys that play bridge stick together even the guys that

belong to the goddam book of the month club stick together if you try to have a little

intelligent

now listen old sally said lots of boys get more out of school than that

i agree i agree they do some of them but that s all i get out of it see that s

my point that s exactly my goddam point i said i don t get hardly anything out of

anything i m in bad shape i m in lousy shape

you certainly are

then all of a sudden i got this idea

look i said here s my idea how would you like to get the hell out of here

here s my idea i know this guy down in greenwich village that we can borrow his car

for a couple of weeks he used to go to the same school i did and he still owes me ten

bucks what we could do is tomorrow morning we could drive up to massachusetts and

vermont and all around there see it s beautiful as hell up there it really is i was

getting excited as hell the more i thought of it and i sort of reached over and took old

sally s goddam hand what a goddam fool i was no kidding i said i have about a

hundred and eighty bucks in the bank i can take it out when it opens in the morning and

then i could go down and get this guy s car no kidding we ll stay in these cabin camps

and stuff like that till the dough runs out then when the dough runs out i could get a

job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and later on we could

get married or something i could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all

honest to god we could have a terrific time wuddaya say c mon wuddaya say will

you do it with me please

you can t just do something like that old sally said she sounded sore as hell

why not why the hell not

stop screaming at me please she said which was crap because i wasn t even

screaming at her

why can tcha why not

because you can t that s all in the first place we re both practically children

and did you ever stop to think what you d do if you didn t get a job when your money ran

out we d starve to death the whole thing s so fantastic it isn t even

it isn t fantastic i d get a job don t worry about that you don t have to worry

about that what s the matter don t you want to go with me say so if you don t

it isn t that it isn t that at all old sally said i was beginning to hate her in a

way we ll have oodles of time to do those things all those things i mean after you go

to college and all and if we should get married and all there ll be oodles of marvelous

places to go to you re just

no there wouldn t be there wouldn t be oodles of places to go to at all it d be

entirely different i said i was getting depressed as hell again

what she said i can t hear you one minute you scream at me and the next

you

i said no there wouldn t be marvelous places to go to after i went to college and

all open your ears it d be entirely different we d have to go downstairs in elevators

with suitcases and stuff we d have to phone up everybody and tell em good by and send

em postcards from hotels and all and i d be working in some office making a lot of

dough and riding to work in cabs and madison avenue buses and reading newspapers

and playing bridge all the time and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts

and coming attractions and newsreels newsreels christ almighty there s always a

dumb horse race and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship and some chimpanzee

riding a goddam bicycle with pants on it wouldn t be the same at all you don t see what

i mean at all

maybe i don t maybe you don t either old sally said we both hated each

other s guts by that time you could see there wasn t any sense trying to have an

intelligent conversation i was sorry as hell i d started it

c mon let s get outa here i said you give me a royal pain in the ass if you

want to know the truth

boy did she hit the ceiling when i said that i know i shouldn t ve said it and i

probably wouldn t ve ordinarily but she was depressing the hell out of me usually i

never say crude things like that to girls boy did she hit the ceiling i apologized like a

madman but she wouldn t accept my apology she was even crying which scared me a

little bit because i was a little afraid she d go home and tell her father i called her a pain

in the ass her father was one of those big silent bastards and he wasn t too crazy about

me anyhow he once told old sally i was too goddam noisy

no kidding i m sorry i kept telling her

you re sorry you re sorry that s very funny she said she was still sort of

crying and all of a sudden i did feel sort of sorry i d said it

c mon i ll take ya home no kidding

i can go home by myself thank you if you think i d let you take me home

you re mad no boy ever said that to me in my entire life

the whole thing was sort of funny in a way if you thought about it and all of a

sudden i did something i shouldn t have i laughed and i have one of these very loud

stupid laughs i mean if i ever sat behind myself in a movie or something i d probably

lean over and tell myself to please shut up it made old sally madder than ever

i stuck around for a while apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me but she

wouldn t she kept telling me to go away and leave her alone so finally i did it i went

inside and got my shoes and stuff and left without her i shouldn t ve but i was pretty

goddam fed up by that time

if you want to know the truth i don t even know why i started all that stuff with

her i mean about going away somewhere to massachusetts and vermont and all i

probably wouldn t ve taken her even if she d wanted to go with me she wouldn t have

been anybody to go with the terrible part though is that i meant it when i asked her

that s the terrible part i swear to god i m a madman

18

when i left the skating rink i felt sort of hungry so i went in this drugstore and

had a swiss cheese sandwich and a malted and then i went in a phone booth i thought

maybe i might give old jane another buzz and see if she was home yet i mean i had the

whole evening free and i thought i d give her a buzz and if she was home yet take her

dancing or something somewhere i never danced with her or anything the whole time i

knew her i saw her dancing once though she looked like a very good dancer it was at

this fourth of july dance at the club i didn t know her too well then and i didn t think i

ought to cut in on her date she was dating this terrible guy al pike that went to choate

i didn t know him too well but he was always hanging around the swimming pool he

wore those white lastex kind of swimming trunks and he was always going off the high

dive he did the same lousy old half gainer all day long it was the only dive he could do

but he thought he was very hot stuff all muscles and no brains anyway that s who jane

dated that night i couldn t understand it i swear i couldn t after we started going around

together i asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like al pike jane said

he wasn t a show off she said he had an inferiority complex she acted like she felt sorry

for him or something and she wasn t just putting it on she meant it it s a funny thing

about girls every time you mention some guy that s strictly a bastard very mean or very

conceited and all and when you mention it to the girl she ll tell you he has an inferiority

complex maybe he has but that still doesn t keep him from being a bastard in my

opinion girls you never know what they re going to think i once got this girl roberta

walsh s roommate a date with a friend of mine his name was bob robinson and he

really had an inferiority complex you could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and

all because they said he don t and she don t and stuff like that and they weren t very

wealthy but he wasn t a bastard or anything he was a very nice guy but this roberta

walsh s roommate didn t like him at all she told roberta he was too conceited and the

reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he

was captain of the debating team a little thing like that and she thought he was

conceited the trouble with girls is if they like a boy no matter how big a bastard he is

they ll say he has an inferiority complex and if they don t like him no matter how nice a

guy he is or how big an inferiority complex he has they ll say he s conceited even smart

girls do it

anyway i gave old jane a buzz again but her phone didn t answer so i had to

hang up then i had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be

available for the evening the trouble was though my address book only has about three

people in it jane and this man mr antolini that was my teacher at elkton hills and my

father s office number i keep forgetting to put people s names in so what i did finally i

gave old carl luce a buzz he graduated from the whooton school after i left he was

about three years older than i was and i didn t like him too much but he was one of these

very intellectual guys he had the highest i q of any boy at whooton and i thought he

might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual

conversation he was very enlightening sometimes so i gave him a buzz he went to

columbia now but he lived on 65th street and all and i knew he d be home when i got

him on the phone he said he couldn t make it for dinner but that he d meet me for a drink

at ten o clock at the wicker bar on 54th i think he was pretty surprised to hear from me

i once called him a fat assed phony

i had quite a bit of time to kill till ten o clock so what i did i went to the movies

at radio city it was probably the worst thing i could ve done but it was near and i

couldn t think of anything else

i came in when the goddam stage show was on the rockettes were kicking their

heads off the way they do when they re all in line with their arms around each other s

waist the audience applauded like mad and some guy behind me kept saying to his

wife you know what that is that s precision he killed me then after the rockettes

a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on and started skating under a bunch of little

tables and telling jokes while he did it he was a very good skater and all but i couldn t

enjoy it much because i kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller skates on the

stage it seemed so stupid i guess i just wasn t in the right mood then after him they

had this christmas thing they have at radio city every year all these angels start coming

out of the boxes and everywhere guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place

and the whole bunch of them thousands of them singing come all ye faithful like

mad big deal it s supposed to be religious as hell i know and very pretty and all but i

can t see anything religious or pretty for god s sake about a bunch of actors carrying

crucifixes all over the stage when they were all finished and started going out the boxes

again you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something i saw it with

old sally hayes the year before and she kept saying how beautiful it was the costumes

and all i said old jesus probably would ve puked if he could see it all those fancy

costumes and all sally said i was a sacrilegious atheist i probably am the thing jesus

really would ve liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra i ve

watched that guy since i was about eight years old my brother allie and i if we were

with our parents and all we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch

him he s the best drummer i ever saw he only gets a chance to bang them a couple of

times during a whole piece but he never looks bored when he isn t doing it then when

he does bang them he does it so nice and sweet with this nervous expression on his face

one time when we went to washington with my father allie sent him a postcard but i ll

bet he never got it we weren t too sure how to address it

after the christmas thing was over the goddam picture started it was so putrid i

couldn t take my eyes off it it was about this english guy alec something that was in

the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all he comes out of the hospital

carrying a cane and limping all over the place all over london not knowing who the hell

he is he s really a duke but he doesn t know it then he meets this nice homey sincere

girl getting on a bus her goddam hat blows off and he catches it and then they go

upstairs and sit down and start talking about charles dickens he s both their favorite

author and all he s carrying this copy of oliver twist and so s she i could ve puked

anyway they fell in love right away on account of they re both so nuts about charles

dickens and all and he helps her run her publishing business she s a publisher the girl

only she s not doing so hot because her brother s a drunkard and he spends all their

dough he s a very bitter guy the brother because he was a doctor in the war and now he

can t operate any more because his nerves are shot so he boozes all the time but he s

pretty witty and all anyway old alec writes a book and this girl publishes it and they

both make a hatful of dough on it they re all set to get married when this other girl old

marcia shows up marcia was alec s fiancée before he lost his memory and she

recognizes him when he s in this store autographing books she tells old alec he s really a

duke and all but he doesn t believe her and doesn t want to go with her to visit his mother

and all his mother s blind as a bat but the other girl the homey one makes him go

she s very noble and all so he goes but he still doesn t get his memory back even when

his great dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and

brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid but then

one day some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with

a cricket ball then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and

kisses his mother on the forehead and all then he starts being a regular duke again and

he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business i d tell you the rest

of the story but i might puke if i did it isn t that i d spoil it for you or anything there

isn t anything to spoil for chrissake anyway it ends up with alec and the homey babe

getting married and the brother that s a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on

alec s mother so she can see again and then the drunken brother and old marcia go for

each other it ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off

because the great dane comes in with a bunch of puppies everybody thought it was a

male i suppose or some goddam thing all i can say is don t see it if you don t want to

puke all over yourself

the part that got me was there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through

the goddam picture the phonier it got the more she cried you d have thought she did it

because she was kindhearted as hell but i was sitting right next to her and she wasn t

she had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom but

she wouldn t take him she kept telling him to sit still and behave himself she was about

as kindhearted as a goddam wolf you take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out

over phony stuff in the movies and nine times out of ten they re mean bastards at heart

i m not kidding

after the movie was over i started walking down to the wicker bar where i was

supposed to meet old carl luce and while i walked i sort of thought about war and all

those war movies always do that to me i don t think i could stand it if i had to go to war

i really couldn t it wouldn t be too bad if they d just take you out and shoot you or

something but you have to stay in the army so goddam long that s the whole trouble

my brother d b was in the army for four goddam years he was in the war too he

landed on d day and all but i really think he hated the army worse than the war i was

practically a child at the time but i remember when he used to come home on furlough

and all all he did was lie on his bed practically he hardly ever even came in the living

room later when he went overseas and was in the war and all he didn t get wounded or

anything and he didn t have to shoot anybody all he had to do was drive some cowboy

general around all day in a command car he once told allie and i that if he d had to

shoot anybody he wouldn t ve known which direction to shoot in he said the army was

practically as full of bastards as the nazis were i remember allie once asked him wasn t

it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave him a lot to

write about and all he made allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who

was the best war poet rupert brooke or emily dickinson allie said emily dickinson i

don t know too much about it myself because i don t read much poetry but i do know it d

drive me crazy if i had to be in the army and be with a bunch of guys like ackley and

stradlater and old maurice all the time marching with them and all i was in the boy

scouts once for about a week and i couldn t even stand looking at the back of the guy s

neck in front of me they kept telling you to look at the back of the guy s neck in front of

you i swear if there s ever another war they better just take me out and stick me in front

of a firing squad i wouldn t object what gets me about d b though he hated the war so

much and yet he got me to read this book a farewell to arms last summer he said it

was so terrific that s what i can t understand it had this guy in it named lieutenant

henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all i don t see how d b could hate the

army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that i mean for instance i don t

see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by ring lardner or

that other one he s so crazy about the great gatsby d b got sore when i said that and

said i was too young and all to appreciate it but i don t think so i told him i liked ring

lardner and the great gatsby and all i did too i was crazy about the great gatsby

old gatsby old sport that killed me anyway i m sort of glad they ve got the atomic

bomb invented if there s ever another war i m going to sit right the hell on top of it i ll

volunteer for it i swear to god i will

19

in case you don t live in new york the wicker bar is in this sort of swanky hotel

the seton hotel i used to go there quite a lot but i don t any more i gradually cut it out

it s one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all and the phonies

are coming in the window they used to have these two french babes tina and janine

come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night one of them played

the piano strictly lousy and the other one sang and most of the songs were either pretty

dirty or in french the one that sang old janine was always whispering into the goddam

microphone before she sang she d say and now we like to geeve you our impression of

vooly voo fransay eet ees the story of a leetle fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety

just like new york and falls een love wees a leetle boy from brookleen we hope you

like eet then when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell she d sing some

dopey song half in english and half in french and drive all the phonies in the place mad

with joy if you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and

all you got to hate everybody in the world i swear you did the bartender was a louse

too he was a big snob he didn t talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a

celebrity or something if you were a big shot or a celebrity or something then he was

even more nauseating he d go up to you and say with this big charming smile like he

was a helluva swell guy if you knew him well how s connecticut or how s

florida it was a terrible place i m not kidding i cut out going there entirely gradually

it was pretty early when i got there i sat down at the bar it was pretty crowded

and had a couple of scotch and sodas before old luce even showed up i stood up when i

ordered them so they could see how tall i was and all and not think i was a goddam

minor then i watched the phonies for a while some guy next to me was snowing hell

out of the babe he was with he kept telling her she had aristocratic hands that killed

me the other end of the bar was full of flits they weren t too flitty looking i mean they

didn t have their hair too long or anything but you could tell they were flits anyway

finally old luce showed up

old luce what a guy he was supposed to be my student adviser when i was at

whooton the only thing he ever did though was give these sex talks and all late at

night when there was a bunch of guys in his room he knew quite a bit about sex

especially perverts and all he was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go

around having affairs with sheep and guys that go around with girls pants sewed in the

lining of their hats and all and flits and lesbians old luce knew who every flit and

lesbian in the united states was all you had to do was mention somebody anybody

and old luce d tell you if he was a flit or not sometimes it was hard to believe the

people he said were flits and lesbians and all movie actors and like that some of the

ones he said were flits were even married for god s sake you d keep saying to him

you mean joe blow s a flit joe blow that big tough guy that plays gangsters and

cowboys all the time old luce d say certainly he was always saying certainly

he said it didn t matter if a guy was married or not he said half the married guys in the

world were flits and didn t even know it he said you could turn into one practically

overnight if you had all the traits and all he used to scare the hell out of us i kept

waiting to turn into a flit or something the funny thing about old luce i used to think he

was sort of flitty himself in a way he was always saying try this for size and then

he d goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor and whenever he

went to the can he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were

brushing your teeth or something that stuff s sort of flitty it really is i ve known quite a

few real flits at schools and all and they re always doing stuff like that and that s why i

always had my doubts about old luce he was a pretty intelligent guy though he really

was

he never said hello or anything when he met you the first thing he said when he

sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes he said he had a date then he

ordered a dry martini he told the bartender to make it very dry and no olive

hey i got a flit for you i told him at the end of the bar don t look now i

been saving him for ya

very funny he said same old caulfield when are you going to grow up

i bored him a lot i really did he amused me though he was one of those guys

that sort of amuse me a lot

how s your sex life i asked him he hated you to ask him stuff like that

relax he said just sit back and relax for chrissake

i m relaxed i said how s columbia ya like it

certainly i like it if i didn t like it i wouldn t have gone there he said he could

be pretty boring himself sometimes

what re you majoring in i asked him perverts i was only horsing around

what re you trying to be funny

no i m only kidding i said listen hey luce you re one of these intellectual

guys i need your advice i m in a terrific

he let out this big groan on me listen caulfield if you want to sit here and

have a quiet peaceful drink and a quiet peaceful conver

all right all right i said relax you could tell he didn t feel like discussing

anything serious with me that s the trouble with these intellectual guys they never want

to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it so all i did was i started discussing

topics in general with him no kidding how s your sex life i asked him you still

going around with that same babe you used to at whooton the one with the terrffic

good god no he said

how come what happened to her

i haven t the faintest idea for all i know since you ask she s probably the

whore of new hampshire by this time

that isn t nice if she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time

you at least shouldn t talk about her that way

oh god old luce said is this going to be a typical caulfield conversation i

want to know right now

no i said but it isn t nice anyway if she was decent and nice enough to let

you

must we pursue this horrible trend of thought

i didn t say anything i was sort of afraid he d get up and leave on me if i didn t

shut up so all i did was i ordered another drink i felt like getting stinking drunk

who re you going around with now i asked him you feel like telling me

nobody you know

yeah but who i might know her

girl lives in the village sculptress if you must know

yeah no kidding how old is she

i ve never asked her for god s sake

well around how old

i should imagine she s in her late thirties old luce said

in her late thirties yeah you like that i asked him you like em that old

the reason i was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all he was

one of the few guys i knew that did he lost his virginity when he was only fourteen in

nantucket he really did

i like a mature person if that s what you mean certainly

you do why no kidding they better for sex and all

listen let s get one thing straight i refuse to answer any typical caulfield

questions tonight when in hell are you going to grow up

i didn t say anything for a while i let it drop for a while then old luce ordered

another martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer

listen how long you been going around with her this sculpture babe i asked

him i was really interested did you know her when you were at whooton

hardly she just arrived in this country a few months ago

she did where s she from

she happens to be from shanghai

no kidding she chinese for chrissake

obviously

no kidding do you like that her being chinese

obviously

why i d be interested to know i really would

i simply happen to find eastern philosophy more satisfactory than western

since you ask

you do wuddaya mean philosophy ya mean sex and all you mean it s better

in china that what you mean

not necessarily in china for god s sake the east i said must we go on with

this inane conversation

listen i m serious i said no kidding why s it better in the east

it s too involved to go into for god s sake old luce said they simply happen

to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience if you think i m

so do i so do i regard it as a wuddayacallit a physical and spiritual experience

and all i really do but it depends on who the hell i m doing it with if i m doing it with

somebody i don t even

not so loud for god s sake caulfield if you can t manage to keep your voice

down let s drop the whole

all right but listen i said i was getting excited and i was talking a little too

loud sometimes i talk a little loud when i get excited this is what i mean though i

said i know it s supposed to be physical and spiritual and artistic and all but what i

mean is you can t do it with everybody every girl you neck with and all and make it

come out that way can you

let s drop it old luce said do you mind

all right but listen take you and this chinese babe what s so good about you

two

drop it i said

i was getting a little too personal i realize that but that was one of the annoying

things about luce when we were at whooton he d make you describe the most personal

stuff that happened to you but if you started asking him questions about himself he got

sore these intellectual guys don t like to have an intellectual conversation with you

unless they re running the whole thing they always want you to shut up when they shut

up and go back to your room when they go back to their room when i was at whooton

old luce used to hate it you really could tell he did when after he was finished giving

his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves

for a while i mean the other guys and myself in somebody else s room old luce hated

that he always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was

finished being the big shot the thing he was afraid of he was afraid somebody d say

something smarter than he had he really amused me

maybe i ll go to china my sex life is lousy i said

naturally your mind is immature

it is it really is i know it i said you know what the trouble with me is i can

never get really sexy i mean really sexy with a girl i don t like a lot i mean i have to

like her a lot if i don t i sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all boy it really

screws up my sex life something awful my sex life stinks

naturally it does for god s sake i told you the last time i saw you what you

need

you mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all i said that s what he d told me i

ought to do his father was a psychoanalyst and all

it s up to you for god s sake it s none of my goddam business what you do with

your life

i didn t say anything for a while i was thinking

supposing i went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all i said

what would he do to me i mean what would he do to me

he wouldn t do a goddam thing to you he d simply talk to you and you d talk to

him for god s sake for one thing he d help you to recognize the patterns of your mind

the what

the patterns of your mind your mind runs in listen i m not giving an

elementary course in psychoanalysis if you re interested call him up and make an

appointment if you re not don t i couldn t care less frankly

i put my hand on his shoulder boy he amused me you re a real friendly

bastard i told him you know that

he was looking at his wrist watch i have to tear he said and stood up nice

seeing you he got the bartender and told him to bring him his check

hey i said just before he beat it did your father ever psychoanalyze you

me why do you ask

no reason did he though has he

not exactly he s helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent but an extensive

analysis hasn t been necessary why do you ask

no reason i was just wondering

well take it easy he said he was leaving his tip and all and he was starting to

go

have just one more drink i told him please i m lonesome as hell no

kidding

he said he couldn t do it though he said he was late now and then he left

old luce he was strictly a pain in the ass but he certainly had a good

vocabulary he had the largest vocabulary of any boy at whooton when i was there they

gave us a test

20

i kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old tina and janine to come out

and do their stuff but they weren t there a flitty looking guy with wavy hair came out

and played the piano and then this new babe valencia came out and sang she wasn t

any good but she was better than old tina and janine and at least she sang good songs

the piano was right next to the bar where i was sitting and all and old valencia was

standing practically right next to me i sort of gave her the old eye but she pretended she

didn t even see me i probably wouldn t have done it but i was getting drunk as hell

when she was finished she beat it out of the room so fast i didn t even get a chance to

invite her to join me for a drink so i called the headwaiter over i told him to ask old

valencia if she d care to join me for a drink he said he would but he probably didn t

even give her my message people never give your message to anybody

boy i sat at that goddam bar till around one o clock or so getting drunk as a

bastard i could hardly see straight the one thing i did though i was careful as hell not

to get boisterous or anything i didn t want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how

old i was but boy i could hardly see straight when i was really drunk i started that

stupid business with the bullet in my guts again i was the only guy at the bar with a

bullet in their guts i kept putting my hand under my jacket on my stomach and all to

keep the blood from dripping all over the place i didn t want anybody to know i was

even wounded i was concealing the fact that i was a wounded sonuvabitch finally what

i felt like i felt like giving old jane a buzz and see if she was home yet so i paid my

check and all then i left the bar and went out where the telephones were i kept keeping

my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping boy was i drunk

but when i got inside this phone booth i wasn t much in the mood any more to

give old jane a buzz i was too drunk i guess so what i did i gave old sally hayes a

buzz

i had to dial about twenty numbers before i got the right one boy was i blind

hello i said when somebody answered the goddam phone i sort of yelled it i

was so drunk

who is this this very cold lady s voice said

hey sally you want me trimma tree for ya ya want me to huh

yes good night go home and go to bed

she hung up on me

g night g night sally baby sally sweetheart darling i said can you imagine

how drunk i was i hung up too then i figured she probably just came home from a date

i pictured her out with the lunts and all somewhere and that andover jerk all of them

swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and

being charming and phony i wished to god i hadn t even phoned her when i m drunk

i m a madman

i stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while i kept holding onto the phone

sort of so i wouldn t pass out i wasn t feeling too marvelous to tell you the truth

finally though i came out and went in the men s room staggering around like a moron

and filled one of the washbowls with cold water then i dunked my head in it right up to

the ears i didn t even bother to dry it or anything i just let the sonuvabitch drip then i

walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it it was nice and warm it

felt good because i was shivering like a bastard it s a funny thing i always shiver like

hell when i m drunk

i didn t have anything else to do so i kept sitting on the radiator and counting

these little white squares on the floor i was getting soaked about a gallon of water was

dripping down my neck getting all over my collar and tie and all but i didn t give a

damn i was too drunk to give a damn then pretty soon the guy that played the piano

for old valencia this very wavyhaired flitty looking guy came in to comb his golden

locks we sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it except that he wasn t

too goddam friendly

hey you gonna see that valencia babe when you go back in the bar i asked

him

it s highly probable he said witty bastard all i ever meet is witty bastards

listen give her my compliments ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my

message willya

why don t you go home mac how old are you anyway

eighty six listen give her my compliments okay

why don t you go home mac

not me boy you can play that goddam piano i told him i was just flattering

him he played the piano stinking if you want to know the truth you oughta go on the

radio i said handsome chap like you all those goddam golden locks ya need a

manager

go home mac like a good guy go home and hit the sack

no home to go to no kidding you need a manager

he didn t answer me he just went out he was all through combing his hair and

patting it and all so he left like stradlater all these handsome guys are the same when

they re done combing their goddam hair they beat it on you

when i finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat check room i

was crying and all i don t know why but i was i guess it was because i was feeling so

damn depressed and lonesome then when i went out to the checkroom i couldn t find

my goddam check the hat check girl was very nice about it though she gave me my

coat anyway and my little shirley beans record i still had it with me and all i gave

her a buck for being so nice but she wouldn t take it she kept telling me to go home and

go to bed i sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working but

she wouldn t do it she said she was old enough to be my mother and all i showed her

my goddam gray hair and told her i was forty two i was only horsing around naturally

she was nice though i showed her my goddam red hunting hat and she liked it she

made me put it on before i went out because my hair was still pretty wet she was all

right

i didn t feel too drunk any more when i went outside but it was getting very cold

out again and my teeth started chattering like hell i couldn t make them stop i walked

over to madison avenue and started to wait around for a bus because i didn t have hardly

any money left and i had to start economizing on cabs and all but i didn t feel like

getting on a damn bus and besides i didn t even know where i was supposed to go so

what i did i started walking over to the park i figured i d go by that little lake and see

what the hell the ducks were doing see if they were around or not i still didn t know if

they were around or not it wasn t far over to the park and i didn t have anyplace else

special to go to i didn t even know where i was going to sleep yet so i went i wasn t

tired or anything i just felt blue as hell

then something terrible happened just as i got in the park i dropped old phoebe s

record it broke into about fifty pieces it was in a big envelope and all but it broke

anyway i damn near cried it made me feel so terrible but all i did was i took the pieces

out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket they weren t any good for anything

but i didn t feel like just throwing them away then i went in the park boy was it dark

i ve lived in new york all my life and i know central park like the back of my

hand because i used to roller skate there all the time and ride my bike when i was a kid

but i had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night i knew right where it

was it was right near central park south and all but i still couldn t find it i must ve

been drunker than i thought i kept walking and walking and it kept getting darker and

darker and spookier and spookier i didn t see one person the whole time i was in the

park i m just as glad i probably would ve jumped about a mile if i had then finally i

found it what it was it was partly frozen and partly not frozen but i didn t see any

ducks around i walked all around the whole damn lake i damn near fell in once in fact

but i didn t see a single duck i thought maybe if there were any around they might be

asleep or something near the edge of the water near the grass and all that s how i nearly

fell in but i couldn t find any

finally i sat down on this bench where it wasn t so goddam dark boy i was still

shivering like a bastard and the back of my hair even though i had my hunting hat on

was sort of full of little hunks of ice that worried me i thought probably i d get

pneumonia and die i started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all my

grandfather from detroit that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride

on a goddam bus with him and my aunts i have about fifty aunts and all my lousy

cousins what a mob d be there they all came when allie died the whole goddam stupid

bunch of them i have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he

looked lying there d b told me i wasn t there i was still in the hospital i had to go to

the hospital and all after i hurt my hand anyway i kept worrying that i was getting

pneumonia with all those hunks of ice in my hair and that i was going to die i felt sorry

as hell for my mother and father especially my mother because she still isn t over my

brother allie yet i kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and

athletic equipment and all the only good thing i knew she wouldn t let old phoebe come

to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid that was the only good part

then i thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all

with my name on this tombstone and all surrounded by dead guys boy when you re

dead they really fix you up i hope to hell when i do die somebody has sense enough to

just dump me in the river or something anything except sticking me in a goddam

cemetery people coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on sunday and

all that crap who wants flowers when you re dead nobody

when the weather s nice my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of

flowers on old allie s grave i went with them a couple of times but i cut it out in the

first place i certainly don t enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery surrounded by dead

guys and tombstones and all it wasn t too bad when the sun was out but twice twice

we were there when it started to rain it was awful it rained on his lousy tombstone and

it rained on the grass on his stomach it rained all over the place all the visitors that were

visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars that s what nearly drove

me crazy all the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then

go someplace nice for dinner everybody except allie i couldn t stand it i know it s only

his body and all that s in the cemetery and his soul s in heaven and all that crap but i

couldn t stand it anyway i just wish he wasn t there you didn t know him if you d

known him you d know what i mean it s not too bad when the sun s out but the sun only

comes out when it feels like coming out

after a while just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all i took out my

dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp all i had was three

singles and five quarters and a nickel left boy i spent a fortune since i left pencey then

what i did i went down near the lagoon and i sort of skipped the quarters and the nickel

across it where it wasn t frozen i don t know why i did it but i did it i guess i thought

it d take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying it didn t though

i started thinking how old phoebe would feel if i got pneumonia and died it was a

childish way to think but i couldn t stop myself she d feel pretty bad if something like

that happened she likes me a lot i mean she s quite fond of me she really is anyway i

couldn t get that off my mind so finally what i figured i d do i figured i d better sneak

home and see her in case i died and all i had my door key with me and all and i figured

what i d do i d sneak in the apartment very quiet and all and just sort of chew the fat

with her for a while the only thing that worried me was our front door it creaks like a

bastard it s a pretty old apartment house and the superintendent s a lazy bastard and

everything creaks and squeaks i was afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in but i

decided i d try it anyhow

so i got the hell out of the park and went home i walked all the way it wasn t

too far and i wasn t tired or even drunk any more it was just very cold and nobody

around anywhere

21

the best break i had in years when i got home the regular night elevator boy

pete wasn t on the car some new guy i d never seen was on the car so i figured that if i

didn t bump smack into my parents and all i d be able to say hello to old phoebe and then

beat it and nobody d even know i d been around it was really a terrific break what made

it even better the new elevator boy was sort of on the stupid side i told him in this very

casual voice to take me up to the dicksteins the dicksteins were these people that had

the other apartment on our floor i d already taken off my hunting hat so as not to look

suspicious or anything i went in the elevator like i was in a terrific hurry

he had the elevator doors all shut and all and was all set to take me up and then

he turned around and said they ain t in they re at a party on the fourteenth floor

that s all right i said i m supposed to wait for them i m their nephew

he gave me this sort of stupid suspicious look you better wait in the lobby

fella he said

i d like to i really would i said but i have a bad leg i have to hold it in a

certain position i think i d better sit down in the chair outside their door

he didn t know what the hell i was talking about so all he said was oh and took

me up not bad boy it s funny all you have to do is say something nobody understands

and they ll do practically anything you want them to

i got off at our floor limping like a bastard and started walking over toward the

dicksteins side then when i heard the elevator doors shut i turned around and went

over to our side i was doing all right i didn t even feel drunk anymore then i took out

my door key and opened our door quiet as hell then very very carefully and all i went

inside and closed the door i really should ve been a crook

it was dark as hell in the foyer naturally and naturally i couldn t turn on any

lights i had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket i certainly knew i

was home though our foyer has a funny smell that doesn t smell like anyplace else i

don t know what the hell it is it isn t cauliflower and it isn t perfume i don t know what

the hell it is but you always know you re home i started to take off my coat and hang it

up in the foyer closet but that closet s full of hangers that rattle like madmen when you

open the door so i left it on then i started walking very very slowly back toward old

phoebe s room i knew the maid wouldn t hear me because she had only one eardrum she

had this brother that stuck a straw down her ear when she was a kid she once told me

she was pretty deaf and all but my parents especially my mother she has ears like a

goddam bloodhound so i took it very very easy when i went past their door i even held

my breath for god s sake you can hit my father over the head with a chair and he won t

wake up but my mother all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in siberia

and she ll hear you she s nervous as hell half the time she s up all night smoking

cigarettes

finally after about an hour i got to old phoebe s room she wasn t there though

i forgot about that i forgot she always sleeps in d b s room when he s away in

hollywood or some place she likes it because it s the biggest room in the house also

because it has this big old madman desk in it that d b bought off some lady alcoholic in

philadelphia and this big gigantic bed that s about ten miles wide and ten miles long i

don t know where he bought that bed anyway old phoebe likes to sleep in d b s room

when he s away and he lets her you ought to see her doing her homework or something

at that crazy desk it s almost as big as the bed you can hardly see her when she s doing

her homework that s the kind of stuff she likes though she doesn t like her own room

because it s too little she says she says she likes to spread out that kills me what s old

phoebe got to spread out nothing

anyway i went into d b s room quiet as hell and turned on the lamp on the

desk old phoebe didn t even wake up when the light was on and all i sort of looked at

her for a while she was laying there asleep with her face sort of on the side of the

pillow she had her mouth way open it s funny you take adults they look lousy when

they re asleep and they have their mouths way open but kids don t kids look all right

they can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look all right

i went around the room very quiet and all looking at stuff for a while i felt

swell for a change i didn t even feel like i was getting pneumonia or anything any more

i just felt good for a change old phoebe s clothes were on this chair right next to the

bed she s very neat for a child i mean she doesn t just throw her stuff around like some

kids she s no slob she had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in canada

hung up on the back of the chair then her blouse and stuff were on the seat her shoes

and socks were on the floor right underneath the chair right next to each other i never

saw the shoes before they were new they were these dark brown loafers sort of like

this pair i have and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in canada my

mother dresses her nice she really does my mother has terrific taste in some things

she s no good at buying ice skates or anything like that but clothes she s perfect i mean

phoebe always has some dress on that can kill you you take most little kids even if their

parents are wealthy and all they usually have some terrible dress on i wish you could see

old phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in canada i m not kidding

i sat down on old d b s desk and looked at the stuff on it it was mostly phoebe s

stuff from school and all mostly books the one on top was called arithmetic is fun i

sort of opened the first page and took a look at it this is what old phoebe had on it

phoebe weatherfield caulfield

4b 1

that killed me her middle name is josephine for god s sake not weatherfield

she doesn t like it though every time i see her she s got a new middle name for herself

the book underneath the arithmetic was a geography and the book under the

geography was a speller she s very good in spelling she s very good in all her subjects

but she s best in spelling then under the speller there were a bunch of notebooks she

has about five thousand notebooks you never saw a kid with so many notebooks i

opened the one on top and looked at the first page it had on it

bernice meet me at recess i have something

very very important to tell you

that was all there was on that page the next one had on it

why has south eastern alaska so many caning factories

because theres so much salmon

why has it valuable forests

because it has the right climate

what has our government done to make

life easier for the alaskan eskimos

look it up for tomorrow

phoebe weatherfield caulfield

phoebe weatherfield caulfield

phoebe w caulfield

phoebe weatherfield caulfield esq

please pass to shirley

shirley you said you were sagitarius

when you come over to my house

i sat there on d b s desk and read the whole notebook it didn t take me long and

i can read that kind of stuff some kid s notebook phoebe s or anybody s all day and all

night long kid s notebooks kill me then i lit another cigarette it was my last one i

must ve smoked about three cartons that day then finally i woke her up i mean i

couldn t sit there on that desk for the rest of my life and besides i was afraid my parents

might barge in on me all of a sudden and i wanted to at least say hello to her before they

did so i woke her up

she wakes up very easily i mean you don t have to yell at her or anything all

you have to do practically is sit down on the bed and say wake up phoeb and bingo

she s awake

holden she said right away she put her arms around my neck and all she s

very affectionate i mean she s quite affectionate for a child sometimes she s even too

affectionate i sort of gave her a kiss and she said whenja get home7 she was glad as

hell to see me you could tell

not so loud just now how are ya anyway

i m fine did you get my letter i wrote you a five page

yeah not so loud thanks

she wrote me this letter i didn t get a chance to answer it though it was all about

this play she was in in school she told me not to make any dates or anything for friday

so that i could come see it

how s the play i asked her what d you say the name of it was

a christmas pageant for americans it stinks but i m benedict arnold i have

practically the biggest part she said boy was she wide awake she gets very excited

when she tells you that stuff it starts out when i m dying this ghost comes in on

christmas eve and asks me if i m ashamed and everything you know for betraying my

country and everything are you coming to it she was sitting way the hell up in the bed

and all that s what i wrote you about are you

sure i m coming certainly i m coming

daddy can t come he has to fly to california she said boy was she wide

awake it only takes her about two seconds to get wide awake she was sitting sort of

kneeling way up in bed and she was holding my goddam hand listen mother said

you d be home wednesday she said she said wednesday

i got out early not so loud you ll wake everybody up

what time is it they won t be home till very late mother said they went to a

party in norwalk connecticut old phoebe said guess what i did this afternoon what

movie i saw guess

i don t know listen didn t they say what time they d

the doctor old phoebe said it s a special movie they had at the lister

foundation just this one day they had it today was the only day it was all about this

doctor in kentucky and everything that sticks a blanket over this child s face that s a

cripple and can t walk then they send him to jail and everything it was excellent

listen a second didn t they say what time they d

he feels sorry for it the doctor that s why he sticks this blanket over her face

and everything and makes her suffocate then they make him go to jail for life

imprisonment but this child that he stuck the blanket over its head comes to visit him all

the time and thanks him for what he did he was a mercy killer only he knows he

deserves to go to jail because a doctor isn t supposed to take things away from god this

girl in my class s mother took us alice holmborg she s my best friend she s the only

girl in the whole

wait a second willya i said i m asking you a question did they say what

time they d be back or didn t they

no but not till very late daddy took the car and everything so they wouldn t

have to worry about trains we have a radio in it now except that mother said nobody

can play it when the car s in traffic

i began to relax sort of i mean i finally quit worrying about whether they d catch

me home or not i figured the hell with it if they did they did

you should ve seen old phoebe she had on these blue pajamas with red elephants

on the collars elephants knock her out

so it was a good picture huh i said

swell except alice had a cold and her mother kept asking her all the time if she

felt grippy right in the middle of the picture always in the middle of something

important her mother d lean all over me and everything and ask alice if she felt grippy

it got on my nerves

then i told her about the record listen i bought you a record i told her only

i broke it on the way home i took the pieces out of my coat pocket and showed her i

was plastered i said

gimme the pieces she said i m saving them she took them right out of my

hand and then she put them in the drawer of the night table she kills me

d b coming home for christmas i asked her

he may and he may not mother said it all depends he may have to stay in

hollywood and write a picture about annapolis

annapolis for god s sake

it s a love story and everything guess who s going to be in it what movie star

guess

i m not interested annapolis for god s sake what s d b know about

annapolis for god s sake what s that got to do with the kind of stories he writes i

said boy that stuff drives me crazy that goddam hollywood what d you do to your

arm i asked her i noticed she had this big hunk of adhesive tape on her elbow the

reason i noticed it her pajamas didn t have any sleeves

this boy curtis weintraub that s in my class pushed me while i was going

down the stairs in the park she said wanna see she started taking the crazy adhesive

tape off her arm

leave it alone why d he push you down the stairs

i don t know i think he hates me old phoebe said this other girl and me

selma atterbury put ink and stuff all over his windbreaker

that isn t nice what are you a child for god s sake

no but every time i m in the park he follows me everywhere he s always

following me he gets on my nerves

he probably likes you that s no reason to put ink all

i don t want him to like me she said then she started looking at me funny

holden she said how come you re not home wednesday

what

boy you have to watch her every minute if you don t think she s smart you re

mad

how come you re not home wednesday she asked me you didn t get kicked

out or anything did you

i told you they let us out early they let the whole

you did get kicked out you did old phoebe said then she hit me on the leg

with her fist she gets very fisty when she feels like it you did oh holden she had

her hand on her mouth and all she gets very emotional i swear to god

who said i got kicked out nobody said i

you did you did she said then she smacked me again with her fist if you

don t think that hurts you re crazy daddy ll kill you she said then she flopped on her

stomach on the bed and put the goddam pillow over her head she does that quite

frequently she s a true madman sometimes

cut it out now i said nobody s gonna kill me nobody s gonna even c mon

phoeb take that goddam thing off your head nobody s gonna kill me

she wouldn t take it off though you can t make her do something if she doesn t

want to all she kept saying was daddy s gonna kill you you could hardly understand

her with that goddam pillow over her head

nobody s gonna kill me use your head in the first place i m going away what

i may do i may get a job on a ranch or something for a while i know this guy whose

grandfather s got a ranch in colorado i may get a job out there i said i ll keep in touch

with you and all when i m gone if i go c mon take that off your head c mon hey

phoeb please please willya

she wouldn t take it off though i tried pulling it off but she s strong as hell you

get tired fighting with her boy if she wants to keep a pillow over her head she keeps it

phoebe please c mon outa there i kept saying c mon hey hey weatherfield

c mon out

she wouldn t come out though you can t even reason with her sometimes

finally i got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarettes out of the box

on the table and stuck some in my pocket i was all out

22

when i came back she had the pillow off her head all right i knew she would

but she still wouldn t look at me even though she was laying on her back and all when i

came around the side of the bed and sat down again she turned her crazy face the other

way she was ostracizing the hell out of me just like the fencing team at pencey when i

left all the goddam foils on the subway

how s old hazel weatherfield i said you write any new stories about her i

got that one you sent me right in my suitcase it s down at the station it s very good

daddy ll kill you

boy she really gets something on her mind when she gets something on her mind

no he won t the worst he ll do he ll give me hell again and then he ll send me

to that goddam military school that s all he ll do to me and in the first place i won t

even be around i ll be away i ll be i ll probably be in colorado on this ranch

don t make me laugh you can t even ride a horse

who can t sure i can certainly i can they can teach you in about two

minutes i said stop picking at that she was picking at that adhesive tape on her arm

who gave you that haircut i asked her i just noticed what a stupid haircut somebody

gave her it was way too short

none of your business she said she can be very snotty sometimes she can be

quite snotty i suppose you failed in every single subject again she said very snotty it

was sort of funny too in a way she sounds like a goddam schoolteacher sometimes and

she s only a little child

no i didn t i said i passed english then just for the hell of it i gave her a

pinch on the behind it was sticking way out in the breeze the way she was laying on her

side she has hardly any behind i didn t do it hard but she tried to hit my hand anyway

but she missed

then all of a sudden she said oh why did you do it she meant why did i get

the ax again it made me sort of sad the way she said it

oh god phoebe don t ask me i m sick of everybody asking me that i said a

million reasons why it was one of the worst schools i ever went to it was full of

phonies and mean guys you never saw so many mean guys in your life for instance if

you were having a bull session in somebody s room and somebody wanted to come in

nobody d let them in if they were some dopey pimply guy everybody was always

locking their door when somebody wanted to come in and they had this goddam secret

fraternity that i was too yellow not to join there was this one pimply boring guy robert

ackley that wanted to get in he kept trying to join and they wouldn t let him just

because he was boring and pimply i don t even feel like talking about it it was a stinking

school take my word

old phoebe didn t say anything but she was listen ing i could tell by the back of

her neck that she was listening she always listens when you tell her something and the

funny part is she knows half the time what the hell you re talking about she really does

i kept talking about old pencey i sort of felt like it

even the couple of nice teachers on the faculty they were phonies too i said

there was this one old guy mr spencer his wife was always giving you hot chocolate

and all that stuff and they were really pretty nice but you should ve seen him when the

headmaster old thurmer came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room

he was always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an

hour he was supposed to be incognito or something after a while he d be sitting back

there and then he d start interrupting what old spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny

jokes old spencer d practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all like as if

thurmer was a goddam prince or something

don t swear so much

it would ve made you puke i swear it would i said then on veterans day

they have this day veterans day that all the jerks that graduated from pencey around

1776 come back and walk all over the place with their wives and children and

everybody you should ve seen this one old guy that was about fifty what he did was he

came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if we d mind if he used the

bathroom the bathroom was at the end of the corridor i don t know why the hell he

asked us you know what he said he said he wanted to see if his initials were still in one

of the can doors what he did he carved his goddam stupid sad old initials in one of the

can doors about ninety years ago and he wanted to see if they were still there so my

roommate and i walked him down to the bathroom and all and we had to stand there

while he looked for his initials in all the can doors he kept talking to us the whole time

telling us how when he was at pencey they were the happiest days of his life and giving

us a lot of advice for the future and all boy did he depress me i don t mean he was a

bad guy he wasn t but you don t have to be a bad guy to depress somebody you can be

a good guy and do it all you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony

advice while you re looking for your initials in some can door that s all you have to do i

don t know maybe it wouldn t have been so bad if he hadn t been all out of breath he

was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs and the whole time he was looking

for his initials he kept breathing hard with his nostrils all funny and sad while he kept

telling stradlater and i to get all we could out of pencey god phoebe i can t explain i

just didn t like anything that was happening at pencey i can t explain

old phoebe said something then but i couldn t hear her she had the side of her

mouth right smack on the pillow and i couldn t hear her

what i said take your mouth away i can t hear you with your mouth that

way

you don t like anything that s happening

it made me even more depressed when she said that

yes i do yes i do sure i do don t say that why the hell do you say that

because you don t you don t like any schools you don t like a million things

you don t

i do that s where you re wrong that s exactly where you re wrong why the

hell do you have to say that i said boy was she depressing me

because you don t she said name one thing

one thing one thing i like i said okay

the trouble was i couldn t concentrate too hot sometimes it s hard to

concentrate

one thing i like a lot you mean i asked her

she didn t answer me though she was in a cockeyed position way the hell over

the other side of the bed she was about a thousand miles away c mon answer me i

said one thing i like a lot or one thing i just like

you like a lot

all right i said but the trouble was i couldn t concentrate about all i could

think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beatup old straw

baskets especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims and this boy i knew at

elkton hills there was this one boy at elkton hills named james castle that wouldn t

take back something he said about this very conceited boy phil stabile james castle

called him a very conceited guy and one of stabile s lousy friends went and squealed on

him to stabile so stabile with about six other dirty bastards went down to james

castle s room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back

what he said but he wouldn t do it so they started in on him i won t even tell you what

they did to him it s too repulsive but he still wouldn t take it back old james castle

and you should ve seen him he was a skinny little weak looking guy with wrists about

as big as pencils finally what he did instead of taking back what he said he jumped out

the window i was in the shower and all and even i could hear him land outside but i

just thought something fell out the window a radio or a desk or something not a boy or

anything then i heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs so i

put on my bathrobe and i ran downstairs too and there was old james castle laying right

on the stone steps and all he was dead and his teeth and blood were all over the place

and nobody would even go near him he had on this turtleneck sweater i d lent him all

they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them they didn t even

go to jail

that was about all i could think of though those two nuns i saw at breakfast and

this boy james castle i knew at elkton hills the funny part is i hardly even know

james castle if you want to know the truth he was one of these very quiet guys he was

in my math class but he was way over on the other side of the room and he hardly ever

got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything some guys in school hardly ever get

up to recite or go to the blackboard i think the only time i ever even had a conversation

with him was that time he asked me if he could borrow this turtleneck sweater i had i

damn near dropped dead when he asked me i was so surprised and all i remember i was

brushing my teeth in the can when he asked me he said his cousin was coming in to

take him for a drive and all i didn t even know he knew i had a turtleneck sweater all i

knew about him was that his name was always right ahead of me at roll call cabel r

cabel w castle caulfield i can still remember it if you want to know the truth i

almost didn t lend him my sweater just because i didn t know him too well

what i said to old phoebe she said something to me but i didn t hear her

you can t even think of one thing

yes i can yes i can

well do it then

i like allie i said and i like doing what i m doing right now sitting here with

you and talking and thinking about stuff and

allie s dead you always say that if somebody s dead and everything and in

heaven then it isn t really

i know he s dead don t you think i know that i can still like him though can t

i just because somebody s dead you don t just stop liking them for god s sake

especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that re

alive and all

old phoebe didn t say anything when she can t think of anything to say she

doesn t say a goddam word

anyway i like it now i said i mean right now sitting here with you and just

chewing the fat and horsing

that isn t anything really

it is so something really certainly it is why the hell isn t it people never think

anything is anything really i m getting goddam sick of it

stop swearing all right name something else name something you d like to be

like a scientist or a lawyer or something

i couldn t be a scientist i m no good in science

well a lawyer like daddy and all

lawyers are all right i guess but it doesn t appeal to me i said i mean they re

all right if they go around saving innocent guys lives all the time and like that but you

don t do that kind of stuff if you re a lawyer all you do is make a lot of dough and play

golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink martinis and look like a hot shot and

besides even if you did go around saving guys lives and all how would you know if you

did it because you really wanted to save guys lives or because you did it because what

you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer with everybody slapping you on the

back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over the reporters and

everybody the way it is in the dirty movies how would you know you weren t being a

phony the trouble is you wouldn t

i m not too sure old phoebe knew what the hell i was talking about i mean she s

only a little child and all but she was listening at least if somebody at least listens it s

not too bad

daddy s going to kill you he s going to kill you she said

i wasn t listening though i was thinking about something else something crazy

you know what i d like to be i said you know what i d like to be i mean if i had my

goddam choice

what stop swearing

you know that song if a body catch a body comin through the rye i d like

it s if a body meet a body coming through the rye old phoebe said it s a

poem by robert burns

i know it s a poem by robert burns

she was right though it is if a body meet a body coming through the rye i

didn t know it then though

i thought it was if a body catch a body i said anyway i keep picturing all

these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all thousands of little

kids and nobody s around nobody big i mean except me and i m standing on the edge

of some crazy cliff what i have to do i have to catch everybody if they start to go over

the cliff i mean if they re running and they don t look where they re going i have to come

out from somewhere and catch them that s all i d do all day i d just be the catcher in the

rye and all i know it s crazy but that s the only thing i d really like to be i know it s

crazy

old phoebe didn t say anything for a long time then when she said something

all she said was daddy s going to kill you

i don t give a damn if he does i said i got up from the bed then because what i

wanted to do i wanted to phone up this guy that was my english teacher at elkton hills

mr antolini he lived in new york now he quit elkton hills he took this job teaching

english at n y u i have to make a phone call i told phoebe i ll be right back don t

go to sleep i didn t want her to go to sleep while i was in the living room i knew she

wouldn t but i said it anyway just to make sure

while i was walking toward the door old phoebe said holden and i turned

around

she was sitting way up in bed she looked so pretty i m taking belching lessons

from this girl phyllis margulies she said listen

i listened and i heard something but it wasn t much good i said then i went

out in the living room and called up this teacher i had mr antolini

23

i made it very snappy on the phone because i was afraid my parents would barge

in on me right in the middle of it they didn t though mr antolini was very nice he

said i could come right over if i wanted to i think i probably woke he and his wife up

because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone the first thing he asked me

was if anything was wrong and i said no i said i d flunked out of pencey though i

thought i might as well tell him he said good god when i said that he had a good

sense of humor and all he told me to come right over if i felt like it

he was about the best teacher i ever had mr antolini he was a pretty young

guy not much older than my brother d b and you could kid around with him without

losing your respect for him he was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped

out the window i told you about james castle old mr antolini felt his pulse and all

and then he took off his coat and put it over james castle and carried him all the way

over to the infirmary he didn t even give a damn if his coat got all bloody

when i got back to d b s room old phoebe d turned the radio on this dance

music was coming out she d turned it on low though so the maid wouldn t hear it you

should ve seen her she was sitting smack in the middle of the bed outside the covers

with her legs folded like one of those yogi guys she was listening to the music she kills

me

c mon i said you feel like dancing i taught her how to dance and all when

she was a tiny little kid she s a very good dancer i mean i just taught her a few things

she learned it mostly by herself you can t teach somebody how to really dance

you have shoes on she said

i ll take em off c mon

she practically jumped off the bed and then she waited while i took my shoes off

and then i danced with her for a while she s really damn good i don t like people that

dance with little kids because most of the time it looks terrible i mean if you re out at a

restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor

usually they keep yanking the kid s dress up in the back by mistake and the kid can t

dance worth a damn anyway and it looks terrible but i don t do it out in public with

phoebe or anything we just horse around in the house it s different with her anyway

because she can dance she can follow anything you do i mean if you hold her in close

as hell so that it doesn t matter that your legs are so much longer she stays right with

you you can cross over or do some corny dips or even jitterbug a little and she stays

right with you you can even tango for god s sake

we danced about four numbers in between numbers she s funny as hell she stays

right in position she won t even talk or anything you both have to stay right in position

and wait for the orchestra to start playing again that kills me you re not supposed to

laugh or anything either

anyway we danced about four numbers and then i turned off the radio old

phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the covers i m improving aren t i she

asked me

and how i said i sat down next to her on the bed again i was sort of out of

breath i was smoking so damn much i had hardly any wind she wasn t even out of

breath

feel my forehead she said all of a sudden

why

feel it just feel it once

i felt it i didn t feel anything though

does it feel very feverish she said

no is it supposed to

yes i m making it feel it again

i felt it again and i still didn t feel anything but i said i think it s starting to

now i didn t want her to get a goddam inferiority complex

she nodded i can make it go up to over the thermoneter

thermometer who said so

alice holmborg showed me how you cross your legs and hold your breath and

think of something very very hot a radiator or something then your whole forehead

gets so hot you can burn somebody s hand

that killed me i pulled my hand away from her forehead like i was in terrific

danger thanks for telling me i said

oh i wouldn t ve burned your hand i d ve stopped before it got too shhh

then quick as hell she sat way the hell up in bed

she scared hell out of me when she did that what s the matter i said

the front door she said in this loud whisper it s them

i quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk then i

jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket then i fanned hell out of

the air to get the smoke out i shouldn t even have been smoking for god s sake then i

grabbed my shoes and got in the closet and shut the door boy my heart was beating like

a bastard

i heard my mother come in the room

phoebe she said now stop that i saw the light young lady

hello i heard old phoebe say i couldn t sleep did you have a good time

marvelous my mother said but you could tell she didn t mean it she doesn t

enjoy herself much when she goes out why are you awake may i ask were you warm

enough

i was warm enough i just couldn t sleep

phoebe have you been smoking a cigarette in here tell me the truth please

young lady

what old phoebe said

you heard me

i just lit one for one second i just took one puff then i threw it out the

window

why may i ask

i couldn t sleep

i don t like that phoebe i don t like that at all my mother said do you want

another blanket

no thanks g night old phoebe said she was trying to get rid of her you could

tell

how was the movie my mother said

excellent except alice s mother she kept leaning over and asking her if she felt

grippy during the whole entire movie we took a taxi home

let me feel your forehead

i didn t catch anything she didn t have anything it was just her mother

well go to sleep now how was your dinner

lousy phoebe said

you heard what your father said about using that word what was lousy about it

you had a lovely lamb chop i walked all over lexington avenue just to

the lamb chop was all right but charlene always breathes on me whenever she

puts something down she breathes all over the food and everything she breathes on

everything

well go to sleep give mother a kiss did you say your prayers

i said them in the bathroom g night

good night go right to sleep now i have a splitting headache my mother said

she gets headaches quite frequently she really does

take a few aspirins old phoebe said holden ll be home on wednesday won t

he

so far as i know get under there now way down

i heard my mother go out and close the door i waited a couple of minutes then i

came out of the closet i bumped smack into old phoebe when i did it because it was so

dark and she was out of bed and coming to tell me i hurt you i said you had to

whisper now because they were both home i gotta get a move on i said i found the

edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting on my shoes i was

pretty nervous i admit it

don t go now phoebe whispered wait ll they re asleep

no now now s the best time i said she ll be in the bathroom and daddy ll

turn on the news or something now s the best time i could hardly tie my shoelaces i

was so damn nervous not that they would ve killed me or anything if they d caught me

home but it would ve been very unpleasant and all where the hell are ya i said to old

phoebe it was so dark i couldn t see her

here she was standing right next to me i didn t even see her

i got my damn bags at the station i said listen you got any dough phoeb

i m practically broke

just my christmas dough for presents and all i haven t done any shopping at all

yet

oh i didn t want to take her christmas dough

you want some she said

i don t want to take your christmas dough

i can lend you some she said then i heard her over at d b s desk opening a

million drawers and feeling around with her hand it was pitch black it was so dark in the

room if you go away you won t see me in the play she said her voice sounded funny

when she said it

yes i will i won t go way before that you think i wanna miss the play i said

what i ll do i ll probably stay at mr antolini s house till maybe tuesday night then i ll

come home if i get a chance i ll phone ya

here old phoebe said she was trying to give me the dough but she couldn t

find my hand

where

she put the dough in my hand

hey i don t need all this i said just give me two bucks is all no kidding

here i tried to give it back to her but she wouldn t take it

you can take it all you can pay me back bring it to the play

how much is it for god s sake

eight dollars and eighty five cents sixty five cents i spent some

then all of a sudden i started to cry i couldn t help it i did it so nobody could

hear me but i did it it scared hell out of old phoebe when i started doing it and she

came over and tried to make me stop but once you get started you can t just stop on a

goddam dime i was still sitting on the edge of the bed when i did it and she put her old

arm around my neck and i put my arm around her too but i still couldn t stop for a long

time i thought i was going to choke to death or something boy i scared hell out of poor

old phoebe the damn window was open and everything and i could feel her shivering

and all because all she had on was her pajamas i tried to make her get back in bed but

she wouldn t go finally i stopped but it certainly took me a long long time then i

finished buttoning my coat and all i told her i d keep in touch with her she told me i

could sleep with her if i wanted to but i said no that i d better beat it that mr antolini

was waiting for me and all then i took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it

to her she likes those kind of crazy hats she didn t want to take it but i made her i ll bet

she slept with it on she really likes those kind of hats then i told her again i d give her a

buzz if i got a chance and then i left

it was a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it was getting in for some

reason for one thing i didn t give much of a damn any more if they caught me i really

didn t i figured if they caught me they caught me i almost wished they did in a way

i walked all the way downstairs instead of taking the elevator i went down the

back stairs i nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails but i got out all

right the elevator boy didn t even see me he probably still thinks i m up at the

dicksteins

24

mr and mrs antolini had this very swanky apartment over on sutton place with

two steps that you go down to get in the living room and a bar and all i d been there

quite a few times because after i left elkton hills mr antoilni came up to our house for

dinner quite frequently to find out how i was getting along he wasn t married then then

when he got married i used to play tennis with he and mrs antolini quite frequently out

at the west side tennis club in forest hills long island mrs antolini belonged there

she was lousy with dough she was about sixty years older than mr antolini but they

seemed to get along quite well for one thing they were both very intellectual especially

mr antolini except that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him

sort of like d b mrs antolini was mostly serious she had asthma pretty bad they both

read all d b s stories mrs antolini too and when d b went to hollywood mr

antolini phoned him up and told him not to go he went anyway though mr antolini

said that anybody that could write like d b had no business going out to hollywood

that s exactly what i said practically

i would have walked down to their house because i didn t want to spend any of

phoebe s christmas dough that i didn t have to but i felt funny when i got outside sort of

dizzy so i took a cab i didn t want to but i did i had a helluva time even finding a cab

old mr antolini answered the door when i rang the bell after the elevator boy

finally let me up the bastard he had on his bathrobe and slippers and he had a highball

in one hand he was a pretty sophisticated guy and he was a pretty heavy drinker

holden m boy he said my god he s grown another twenty inches fine to see you

how are you mr antolini how s mrs antolini

we re both just dandy let s have that coat he took my coat off me and hung it

up i expected to see a day old infant in your arms nowhere to turn snowflakes in your

eyelashes he s a very witty guy sometimes he turned around and yelled out to the

kitchen lillian how s the coffee coming lillian was mrs antolini s first name

it s all ready she yelled back is that holden hello holden

hello mrs antolini

you were always yelling when you were there that s because the both of them

were never in the same room at the same time it was sort of funny

sit down holden mr antolini said you could tell he was a little oiled up the

room looked like they d just had a party glasses were all over the place and dishes with

peanuts in them excuse the appearance of the place he said we ve been entertaining

some buffalo friends of mrs antolini s some buffaloes as a matter of fact

i laughed and mrs antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen but i

couldn t hear her what d she say i asked mr antolini

she said not to look at her when she comes in she just arose from the sack

have a cigarette are you smoking now

thanks i said i took a cigarette from the box he offered me just once in a

while i m a moderate smoker

i ll bet you are he said he gave me a light from this big lighter off the table

so you and pencey are no longer one he said he always said things that way

sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didn t he sort of did it a little bit too

much i don t mean he wasn t witty or anything he was but sometimes it gets on your

nerves when somebody s always saying things like so you and pencey are no longer

one d b does it too much sometimes too

what was the trouble mr antolini asked me how d you do in english i ll

show you the door in short order if you flunked english you little ace composition

writer

oh i passed english all right it was mostly literature though i only wrote about

two compositions the whole term i said i flunked oral expression though they had

this course you had to take oral expression that i flunked

why

oh i don t know i didn t feel much like going into it i was still feeling sort of

dizzy or something and i had a helluva headache all of a sudden i really did but you

could tell he was interested so i told him a little bit about it it s this course where each

boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech you know spontaneous and all

and if the boy digresses at all you re supposed to yell digression at him as fast as you

can it just about drove me crazy i got an f in it

why

oh i don t know that digression business got on my nerves i don t know the

trouble with me is i like it when somebody digresses it s more interesting and all

you don t care to have somebody stick to the point when he tells you

something

oh sure i like somebody to stick to the point and all but i don t like them to

stick too much to the point i don t know i guess i don t like it when somebody sticks to

the point all the time the boys that got the best marks in oral expression were the ones

that stuck to the point all the time i admit it but there was this one boy richard

kinsella he didn t stick to the point too much and they were always yelling digression

at him it was terrible because in the first place he was a very nervous guy i mean he

was a very nervous guy and his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to

make a speech and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the

room when his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit though i liked his speeches better

than anybody else s he practically flunked the course though too he got a d plus

because they kept yelling digression at him all the time for instance he made this

speech about this farm his father bought in vermont they kept yelling digression at

him the whole time he was making it and this teacher mr vinson gave him an f on it

because he hadn t told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm

and all what he did was richard kinsella he d start telling you all about that stuff then

all of a sudden he d start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle and

how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty two years old and how he wouldn t let

anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn t want anybody to see him with

a brace on it didn t have much to do with the farm i admit it but it was nice it s nice

when somebody tells you about their uncle especially when they start out telling you

about their father s farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle i

mean it s dirty to keep yelling digression at him when he s all nice and excited i don t

know it s hard to explain i didn t feel too much like trying either for one thing i had

this terrific headache all of a sudden i wished to god old mrs antolini would come in

with the coffee that s something that annoys hell out of me i mean if somebody says

the coffee s all ready and it isn t

holden one short faintly stuffy pedagogical question don t you think there s

a time and place for everything don t you think if someone starts out to tell you about

his father s farm he should stick to his guns then get around to telling you about his

uncle s brace or if his uncle s brace is such a provocative subject shouldn t he have

selected it in the first place as his subject not the farm

i didn t feel much like thinking and answering and all i had a headache and i felt

lousy i even had sort of a stomach ache if you want to know the truth

yes i don t know i guess he should i mean i guess he should ve picked his

uncle as a subject instead of the farm if that interested him most but what i mean is

lots of time you don t know what interests you most till you start talking about something

that doesn t interest you most i mean you can t help it sometimes what i think is you re

supposed to leave somebody alone if he s at least being interesting and he s getting all

excited about something i like it when somebody gets excited about something it s nice

you just didn t know this teacher mr vinson he could drive you crazy sometimes him

and the goddam class i mean he d keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time

some things you just can t do that to i mean you can t hardly ever simplify and unify

something just because somebody wants you to you didn t know this guy mr vinson i

mean he was very intelligent and all but you could tell he didn t have too much brains

coffee gentlemen finally mrs antolini said she came in carrying this tray

with coffee and cakes and stuff on it holden don t you even peek at me i m a mess

hello mrs antolini i said i started to get up and all but mr antolini got hold

of my jacket and pulled me back down old mrs antolini s hair was full of those iron

curler jobs and she didn t have any lipstick or anything on she didn t look too gorgeous

she looked pretty old and all

i ll leave this right here just dive in you two she said she put the tray down

on the cigarette table pushing all these glasses out of the way how s your mother

holden

she s fine thanks i haven t seen her too recently but the last i

darling if holden needs anything everything s in the linen closet the top shelf

i m going to bed i m exhausted mrs antolini said she looked it too can you boys

make up the couch by yourselves

we ll take care of everything you run along to bed mr antolini said he gave

mrs antolini a kiss and she said good by to me and went in the bedroom they were

always kissing each other a lot in public

i had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that was as hard as a

rock all old mr antolini had was another highball though he makes them strong too

you could tell he may get to be an alcoholic if he doesn t watch his step

i had lunch with your dad a couple of weeks ago he said all of a sudden did

you know that

no i didn t

you re aware of course that he s terribly concerned about you

i know it i know he is i said

apparently before he phoned me he d just had a long rather harrowing letter

from your latest headmaster to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort at all

cutting classes coming unprepared to all your classes in general being an all around

i didn t cut any classes you weren t allowed to cut any there were a couple of

them i didn t attend once in a while like that oral expression i told you about but i

didn t cut any

i didn t feel at all like discussing it the coffee made my stomach feel a little

better but i still had this awful headache

mr antolini lit another cigarette he smoked like a fiend then he said frankly

i don t know what the hell to say to you holden

i know i m very hard to talk to i realize that

i have a feeling that you re riding for some kind of a terrible terrible fall but i

don t honestly know what kind are you listening to me

yes

you could tell he was trying to concentrate and all

it may be the kind where at the age of thirty you sit in some bar hating

everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college then

again you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say it s a secret

between he and i or you may end up in some business office throwing paper clips at the

nearest stenographer i just don t know but do you know what i m driving at at all

yes sure i said i did too but you re wrong about that hating business i

mean about hating football players and all you really are i don t hate too many guys

what i may do i may hate them for a little while like this guy stradlater i knew at

pencey and this other boy robert ackley i hated them once in a while i admit it but it

doesn t last too long is what i mean after a while if i didn t see them if they didn t

come in the room or if i didn t see them in the dining room for a couple of meals i sort

of missed them i mean i sort of missed them

mr antolini didn t say anything for a while he got up and got another hunk of

ice and put it in his drink then he sat down again you could tell he was thinking i kept

wishing though that he d continue the conversation in the morning instead of now but

he was hot people are mostly hot to have a discussion when you re not

all right listen to me a minute now i may not word this as memorably as i d

like to but i ll write you a letter about it in a day or two then you can get it all straight

but listen now anyway he started concentrating again then he said this fall i think

you re riding for it s a special kind of fall a horrible kind the man falling isn t permitted

to feel or hear himself hit bottom he just keeps falling and falling the whole

arrangement s designed for men who at some time or other in their lives were looking

for something their own environment couldn t supply them with or they thought their

own environment couldn t supply them with so they gave up looking they gave it up

before they ever really even got started you follow me

yes sir

sure

yes

he got up and poured some more booze in his glass then he sat down again he

didn t say anything for a long time

i don t want to scare you he said but i can very clearly see you dying nobly

one way or another for some highly unworthy cause he gave me a funny look if i

write something down for you will you read it carefully and keep it

yes sure i said i did too i still have the paper he gave me

he went over to this desk on the other side of the room and without sitting down

wrote something on a piece of paper then he came back and sat down with the paper in

his hand oddly enough this wasn t written by a practicing poet it was written by a

psychoanalyst named wilhelm stekel here s what he are you still with me

yes sure i am

here s what he said the mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly

for a cause while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one

he leaned over and handed it to me i read it right when he gave it to me and then

i thanked him and all and put it in my pocket it was nice of him to go to all that trouble

it really was the thing was though i didn t feel much like concentrating boy i felt so

damn tired all of a sudden

you could tell he wasn t tired at all though he was pretty oiled up for one thing

i think that one of these days he said you re going to have to find out where you want

to go and then you ve got to start going there but immediately you can t afford to lose

a minute not you

i nodded because he was looking right at me and all but i wasn t too sure what he

was talking about i was pretty sure i knew but i wasn t too positive at the time i was too

damn tired

and i hate to tell you he said but i think that once you have a fair idea where

you want to go your first move will be to apply yourself in school you ll have to you re

a student whether the idea appeals to you or not you re in love with knowledge and i

think you ll find once you get past all the mr vineses and their oral comp

mr vinsons i said he meant all the mr vinsons not all the mr vineses i

shouldn t have interrupted him though

all right the mr vinsons once you get past all the mr vinsons you re going

to start getting closer and closer that is if you want to and if you look for it and wait for

it to the kind of information that will be very very dear to your heart among other

things you ll find that you re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened

and even sickened by human behavior you re by no means alone on that score you ll be

excited and stimulated to know many many men have been just as troubled morally and

spiritually as you are right now happily some of them kept records of their troubles

you ll learn from them if you want to just as someday if you have something to offer

someone will learn something from you it s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement and it

isn t education it s history it s poetry he stopped and took a big drink out of his

highball then he started again boy he was really hot i was glad i didn t try to stop him

or anything i m not trying to tell you he said that only educated and scholarly men

are able to contribute something valuable to the world it s not so but i do say that

educated and scholarly men if they re brilliant and creative to begin with which

unfortunately is rarely the case tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind

them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative they tend to express themselves

more clearly and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the

end and most important nine times out of ten they have more humility than the

unscholarly thinker do you follow me at all

yes sir

he didn t say anything again for quite a while i don t know if you ve ever done it

but it s sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when they re

thinking and all it really is i kept trying not to yawn it wasn t that i was bored or

anything i wasn t but i was so damn sleepy all of a sudden

something else an academic education will do for you if you go along with it

any considerable distance it ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have what

it ll fit and maybe what it won t after a while you ll have an idea what kind of thoughts

your particular size mind should be wearing for one thing it may save you an

extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don t suit you aren t becoming to you

you ll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly

then all of a sudden i yawned what a rude bastard but i couldn t help it

mr antolini just laughed though c mon he said and got up we ll fix up the

couch for you

i followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheets

and blankets and stuff that was on the top shelf but he couldn t do it with this highball

glass in his hand so he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor and then he took

the stuff down i helped him bring it over to the couch we both made the bed together

he wasn t too hot at it he didn t tuck anything in very tight i didn t care though i

could ve slept standing up i was so tired

how re all your women

they re okay i was being a lousy conversationalist but i didn t feel like it

how s sally he knew old sally hayes i introduced him once

she s all right i had a date with her this afternoon boy it seemed like twenty

years ago we don t have too much in common any more

helluva pretty girl what about that other girl the one you told me about in

maine

oh jane gallagher she s all right i m probably gonna give her a buzz

tomorrow

we were all done making up the couch then it s all yours mr antolini said i

don t know what the hell you re going to do with those legs of yours

that s all right i m used to short beds i said thanks a lot sir you and mrs

antolini really saved my life tonight

you know where the bathroom is if there s anything you want just holler i ll be

in the kitchen for a while will the light bother you

no heck no thanks a lot

all right good night handsome

g night sir thanks a lot

he went out in the kitchen and i went in the bathroom and got undressed and all i

couldn t brush my teeth because i didn t have any toothbrush with me i didn t have any

pajamas either and mr antolini forgot to lend me some so i just went back in the living

room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch and then i got in bed with just my

shorts on it was way too short for me the couch but i really could ve slept standing up

without batting an eyelash i laid awake for just a couple of seconds thinking about all

that stuff mr antolini d told me about finding out the size of your mind and all he was

really a pretty smart guy but i couldn t keep my goddam eyes open and i fell asleep

then something happened i don t even like to talk about it

i woke up all of a sudden i don t know what time it was or anything but i woke

up i felt something on my head some guy s hand boy it really scared hell out of me

what it was it was mr antolini s hand what he was doing was he was sitting on the

floor right next to the couch in the dark and all and he was sort of petting me or patting

me on the goddam head boy i ll bet i jumped about a thousand feet

what the hellya doing i said

nothing i m simply sitting here admiring

what re ya doing anyway i said over again i didn t know what the hell to say

i mean i was embarrassed as hell

how bout keeping your voice down i m simply sitting here

i have to go anyway i said boy was i nervous i started putting on my damn

pants in the dark i could hardly get them on i was so damn nervous i know more damn

perverts at schools and all than anybody you ever met and they re always being perverty

when i m around

you have to go where mr antolini said he was trying to act very goddam

casual and cool and all but he wasn t any too goddam cool take my word

i left my bags and all at the station i think maybe i d better go down and get

them i have all my stuff in them

they ll be there in the morning now go back to bed i m going to bed myself

what s the matter with you

nothing s the matter it s just that all my money and stuff s in one of my bags i ll

be right back i ll get a cab and be right back i said boy i was falling all over myself in

the dark the thing is it isn t mine the money it s my mother s and i

don t be ridiculous holden get back in that bed i m going to bed myself the

money will be there safe and sound in the morn

no no kidding i gotta get going i really do i was damn near all dressed

already except that i couldn t find my tie i couldn t remember where i d put my tie i put

on my jacket and all without it old mr antolini was sitting now in the big chair a little

ways away from me watching me it was dark and all and i couldn t see him so hot but i

knew he was watching me all right he was still boozing too i could see his trusty

highball glass in his hand

you re a very very strange boy

i know it i said i didn t even look around much for my tie so i went without it

good by sir i said thanks a lot no kidding

he kept walking right behind me when i went to the front door and when i rang

the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway all he said was that business about my

being a very very strange boy again strange my ass then he waited in the doorway

and all till the goddam elevator came i never waited so long for an elevator in my whole

goddam life i swear

i didn t know what the hell to talk about while i was waiting for the elevator and

he kept standing there so i said i m gonna start reading some good books i really am

i mean you had to say something it was very embarrassing

you grab your bags and scoot right on back here again i ll leave the door

unlatched

thanks a lot i said g by the elevator was finally there i got in and went

down boy i was shaking like a madman i was sweating too when something perverty

like that happens i start sweating like a bastard that kind of stuff s happened to me

about twenty times since i was a kid i can t stand it

25

when i got outside it was just getting light out it was pretty cold too but it felt

good because i was sweating so much

i didn t know where the hell to go i didn t want to go to another hotel and spend

all phoebe s dough so finally all i did was i walked over to lexington and took the

subway down to grand central my bags were there and all and i figured i d sleep in that

crazy waiting room where all the benches are so that s what i did it wasn t too bad for a

while because there weren t many people around and i could stick my feet up but i don t

feel much like discussing it it wasn t too nice don t ever try it i mean it it ll depress

you

i only slept till around nine o clock because a million people started coming in the

waiting room and i had to take my feet down i can t sleep so hot if i have to keep my feet

on the floor so i sat up i still had that headache it was even worse and i think i was

more depressed than i ever was in my whole life

i didn t want to but i started thinking about old mr antolini and i wondered what

he d tell mrs antolini when she saw i hadn t slept there or anything that part didn t

worry me too much though because i knew mr antolini was very smart and that he

could make up something to tell her he could tell her i d gone home or something that

part didn t worry me much but what did worry me was the part about how i d woke up

and found him patting me on the head and all i mean i wondered if just maybe i was

wrong about thinking be was making a flitty pass at ne i wondered if maybe he just liked

to pat guys on the head when they re asleep i mean how can you tell about that stuff for

sure you can t i even started wondering if maybe i should ve got my bags and gone

back to his house the way i d said i would i mean i started thinking that even if he was a

flit he certainly d been very nice to me i thought how he hadn t minded it when i d called

him up so late and how he d told me to come right over if i felt like it and how he went

to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all

and how he was the only guy that d even gone near that boy james castle i told you about

when he was dead i thought about all that stuff and the more i thought about it the

more depressed i got i mean i started thinking maybe i should ve gone back to his house

maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it the more i thought about it

though the more depressed and screwed up about it i got what made it even worse my

eyes were sore as hell they felt sore and burny from not getting too much sleep besides

that i was getting sort of a cold and i didn t even have a goddam handkerchief with me i

had some in my suitcase but i didn t feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening

it up right in public and all

there was this magazine that somebody d left on the bench next to me so i

started reading it thinking it d make me stop thinking about mr antolini and a million

other things for at least a little while but this damn article i started reading made me feel

almost worse it was all about hormones it described how you should look your face and

eyes and all if your hormones were in good shape and i didn t look that way at all i

looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones so i started getting

worried about my hormones then i read this other article about how you can tell if you

have cancer or not it said if you had any sores in your mouth that didn t heal pretty

quickly it was a sign that you probably had cancer i d had this sore on the inside of my

lip for about two weeks so figured i was getting cancer that magazine was some little

cheerer upper i finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk i figured i d be dead in

a couple of months because i had cancer i really did i was even positive i would be it

certainly didn t make me feel too gorgeous it sort of looked like it was going to rain but i

went for this walk anyway for one thing i figured i ought to get some breakfast i wasn t

at all hungry but i figured i ought to at least eat something i mean at least get something

with some vitamins in it so i started walking way over east where the pretty cheap

restaurants are because i didn t want to spend a lot of dough

while i was walking i passed these two guys that were unloading this big

christmas tree off a truck one guy kept saying to the other guy hold the sonuvabitch

up hold it up for chrissake it certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a christmas

tree it was sort of funny though in an awful way and i started to sort of laugh it was

about the worst thing i could ve done because the minute i started to laugh i thought i

was going to vomit i really did i even started to but it went away i don t know why i

mean i hadn t eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually i have quite a strong

stomach anyway i got over it and i figured i d feel better if i had something to eat so i

went in this very cheap looking restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee only i didn t

eat the doughnuts i couldn t swallow them too well the thing is if you get very

depressed about something it s hard as hell to swallow the waiter was very nice

though he took them back without charging me i just drank the coffee then i left and

started walking over toward fifth avenue

it was monday and all and pretty near christmas and all the stores were open so

it wasn t too bad walking on fifth avenue it was fairly christmasy all those scraggy

looking santa clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells and the salvation

army girls the ones that don t wear any lipstick or anything were tinging bells too i sort

of kept looking around for those two nuns i d met at breakfast the day before but i didn t

see them i knew i wouldn t because they d told me they d come to new york to be

schoolteachers but i kept looking for them anyway anyway it was pretty christmasy all

of a sudden a million little kids were downtown with their mothers getting on and off

buses and coming in and out of stores i wished old phoebe was around she s not little

enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department but she enjoys horsing

around and looking at the people the christmas before last i took her downtown

shopping with me we had a helluva time i think it was in bloomingdale s we went in

the shoe department and we pretended she old phoebe wanted to get a pair of those

very high storm shoes the kind that have about a million holes to lace up we had the

poor salesman guy going crazy old phoebe tried on about twenty pairs and each time

the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up it was a dirty trick but it killed old

phoebe we finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them the salesman was very

nice about it i think he knew we were horsing around because old phoebe always starts

giggling

anyway i kept walking and walking up fifth avenue without any tie on or

anything then all of a sudden something very spooky started happening every time i

came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb i had this feeling that i d

never get to the other side of the street i thought i d just go down down down and

nobody d ever see me again boy did it scare me you can t imagine i started sweating

like a bastard my whole shirt and underwear and everything then i started doing

something else every time i d get to the end of a block i d make believe i was talking to

my brother allie i d say to him allie don t let me disappear allie don t let me

disappear allie don t let me disappear please allie and then when i d reach the other

side of the street without disappearing i d thank him then it would start all over again as

soon as i got to the next corner but i kept going and all i was sort of afraid to stop i

think i don t remember to tell you the truth i know i didn t stop till i was way up in the

sixties past the zoo and all then i sat down on this bench i could hardly get my breath

and i was still sweating like a bastard i sat there i guess for about an hour finally what

i decided i d do i decided i d go away i decided i d never go home again and i d never

go away to another school again i decided i d just see old phoebe and sort of say good

by to her and all and give her back her christmas dough and then i d start hitchhiking

my way out west what i d do i figured i d go down to the holland tunnel and bum a

ride and then i d bum another one and another one and another one and in a few days

i d be somewhere out west where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobody d know

me and i d get a job i figured i could get a job at a filling station somewhere putting gas

and oil in people s cars i didn t care what kind of job it was though just so people didn t

know me and i didn t know anybody i thought what i d do was i d pretend i was one of

those deaf mutes that way i wouldn t have to have any goddam stupid useless

conversations with anybody if anybody wanted to tell me something they d have to

write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me they d get bored as hell doing that

after a while and then i d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life

everybody d think i was just a poor deaf mute bastard and they d leave me alone they d

let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars and they d pay me a salary and all for it and i d

build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough i made and live there for the rest of my

life i d build it right near the woods but not right in them because i d want it to be sunny

as hell all the time i d cook all my own food and later on if i wanted to get married or

something i d meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf mute and we d get married

she d come and live in my cabin with me and if she wanted to say anything to me she d

have to write it on a goddam piece of paper like everybody else if we had any children

we d hide them somewhere we could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to

read and write by ourselves

i got excited as hell thinking about it i really did i knew the part about

pretending i was a deaf mute was crazy but i liked thinking about it anyway but i really

decided to go out west and all all i wanted to do first was say good by to old phoebe

so all of a sudden i ran like a madman across the street i damn near got killed doing it

if you want to know the truth and went in this stationery store and bought a pad and

pencil i figured i d write her a note telling her where to meet me so i could say good by

to her and give her back her christmas dough and then i d take the note up to her school

and get somebody in the principal s office to give it to her but i just put the pad and

pencil in my pocket and started walking fast as hell up to her school i was too excited to

write the note right in the stationery store i walked fast because i wanted her to get the

note before she went home for lunch and i didn t have any too much time

i knew where her school was naturally because i went there myself when i was a

kid when i got there it felt funny i wasn t sure i d remember what it was like inside but

i did it was exactly the same as it was when i went there they had that same big yard

inside that was always sort of dark with those cages around the light bulbs so they

wouldn t break if they got hit with a ball they had those same white circles painted all

over the floor for games and stuff and those same old basketball rings without any nets

just the backboards and the rings

nobody was around at all probably because it wasn t recess period and it wasn t

lunchtime yet all i saw was one little kid a colored kid on his way to the bathroom he

had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket the same way we used to

have to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom

i was still sweating but not so bad any more i went over to the stairs and sat

down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil i d bought the stairs had the same

smell they used to have when i went there like somebody d just taken a leak on them

school stairs always smell like that anyway i sat there and wrote this note

dear phoebe

i can t wait around till wednesday any more so i will

probably hitch hike out west this afternoon meet me at the

museum of art near the door at quarter past 12 if you can and i

will give you your christmas dough back i didn t spend much

love

holden

her school was practically right near the museum and she had to pass it on her

way home for lunch anyway so i knew she could meet me all right

then i started walking up the stairs to the principal s office so i could give the

note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom i folded it about ten times

so nobody d open it you can t trust anybody in a goddam school but i knew they d give

it to her if i was her brother and all

while i was walking up the stairs though all of a sudden i thought i was going to

puke again only i didn t i sat down for a second and then i felt better but while i was

sitting down i saw something that drove me crazy somebody d written fuck you on

the wall it drove me damn near crazy i thought how phoebe and all the other little kids

would see it and how they d wonder what the hell it meant and then finally some dirty

kid would tell them all cockeyed naturally what it meant and how they d all think

about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days i kept wanting to kill

whoever d written it i figured it was some perverty bum that d sneaked in the school late

at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall i kept picturing myself

catching him at it and how i d smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and

goddam dead and bloody but i knew too i wouldn t have the guts to do it i knew that

that made me even more depressed i hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with

my hand if you want to know the truth i was afraid some teacher would catch me

rubbing it off and would think i d written it but i rubbed it out anyway finally then i

went on up to the principal s office

the principal didn t seem to be around but some old lady around a hundred years

old was sitting at a typewriter i told her i was phoebe caulfield s brother in 4b 1 and i

asked her to please give phoebe the note i said it was very important because my mother

was sick and wouldn t have lunch ready for phoebe and that she d have to meet me and

have lunch in a drugstore she was very nice about it the old lady she took the note off

me and called some other lady from the next office and the other lady went to give it to

phoebe then the old lady that was around a hundred years old and i shot the breeze for a

while she was pretty nice and i told her how i d gone there to school too and my

brothers she asked me where i went to school now and i told her pencey and she said

pencey was a very good school even if i d wanted to i wouldn t have had the strength to

straighten her out besides if she thought pencey was a very good school let her think it

you hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old they don t like to

hear it then after a while i left it was funny she yelled good luck at me the same

way old spencer did when i left pencey god how i hate it when somebody yells good

luck at me when i m leaving somewhere it s depressing

i went down by a different staircase and i saw another fuck you on the wall i

tried to rub it off with my hand again but this one was scratched on with a knife or

something it wouldn t come off it s hopeless anyway if you had a million years to do it

in you couldn t rub out even half the fuck you signs in the world it s impossible

i looked at the clock in the recess yard and it was only twenty to twelve so i had

quite a lot of time to kill before i met old phoebe but i just walked over to the museum

anyway there wasn t anyplace else to go i thought maybe i might stop in a phone booth

and give old jane gallagher a buzz before i started bumming my way west but i wasn t

in the mood for one thing i wasn t even sure she was home for vacation yet so i just

went over to the museum and hung around

while i was waiting around for phoebe in the museum right inside the doors and

all these two little kids came up to me and asked me if i knew where the mummies were

the one little kid the one that asked me had his pants open i told him about it so he

buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to me he didn t even bother to go

behind a post or anything he killed me i would ve laughed but i was afraid i d feel like

vomiting again so i didn t where re the mummies fella the kid said again ya

know

i horsed around with the two of them a little bit the mummies what re they i

asked the one kid

you know the mummies them dead guys that get buried in them toons and

all

toons that killed me he meant tombs

how come you two guys aren t in school i said

no school t day the kid that did all the talking said he was lying sure as i m

alive the little bastard i didn t have anything to do though till old phoebe showed up so

i helped them find the place where the mummies were boy i used to know exactly

where they were but i hadn t been in that museum in years

you two guys so interested in mummies i said

yeah

can t your friend talk i said

he ain t my friend he s my brudda

can t he talk i looked at the one that wasn t doing any talking can t you talk

at all i asked him

yeah he said i don t feel like it

finally we found the place where the mummies were and we went in

you know how the egyptians buried their dead i asked the one kid

naa

well you should it s very interesting they wrapped their faces up in these

cloths that were treated with some secret chemical that way they could be buried in their

tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn t rot or anything nobody knows

how to do it except the egyptians even modern science

to get to where the mummies were you had to go down this very narrow sort of

hall with stones on the side that they d taken right out of this pharaoh s tomb and all it

was pretty spooky and you could tell the two hot shots i was with weren t enjoying it too

much they stuck close as hell to me and the one that didn t talk at all practically was

holding onto my sleeve let s go he said to his brother i seen em awreddy c mon

hey he turned around and beat it

he s got a yella streak a mile wide the other one said so long he beat it too

i was the only one left in the tomb then i sort of liked it in a way it was so nice

and peaceful then all of a sudden you d never guess what i saw on the wall another

fuck you it was written with a red crayon or something right under the glass part of

the wall under the stones

that s the whole trouble you can t ever find a place that s nice and peaceful

because there isn t any you may think there is but once you get there when you re not

looking somebody ll sneak up and write fuck you right under your nose try it

sometime i think even if i ever die and they stick me in a cemetery and i have a

tombstone and all it ll say holden caulfield on it and then what year i was born and

what year i died and then right under that it ll say fuck you i m positive in fact

after i came out of the place where the mummies were i had to go to the

bathroom i sort of had diarrhea if you want to know the truth i didn t mind the diarrhea

part too much but something else happened when i was coming out of the can right

before i got to the door i sort of passed out i was lucky though i mean i could ve killed

myself when i hit the floor but all i did was sort of land on my side it was a funny thing

though i felt better after i passed out i really did my arm sort of hurt from where i fell

but i didn t feel so damn dizzy any more

it was about ten after twelve or so then and so i went back and stood by the door

and waited for old phoebe i thought how it might be the last time i d ever see her again

any of my relatives i mean i figured i d probably see them again but not for years i

might come home when i was about thirty five i figured in case somebody got sick and

wanted to see me before they died but that would be the only reason i d leave my cabin

and come back i even started picturing how it would be when i came back i knew my

mother d get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to

my cabin but i d go anyway i d be casual as hell i d make her calm down and then i d

go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a

cigarette cool as all hell i d ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to but i

wouldn t insist or anything what i d do i d let old phoebe come out and visit me in the

summertime and on christmas vacation and easter vacation and i d let d b come out

and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice quiet place for his writing but he couldn t

write any movies in my cabin only stories and books i d have this rule that nobody could

do anything phony when they visited me if anybody tried to do anything phony they

couldn t stay

all of a sudden i looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twenty five of

one i began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady

not to give old phoebe my message i began to get scared that maybe she d told her to

burn it or something it really scared hell out of me i really wanted to see old phoebe

before i hit the road i mean i had her christmas dough and all

finally i saw her i saw her through the glass part of the door the reason i saw

her she had my crazy hunting hat on you could see that hat about ten miles away

i went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her the thing i

couldn t understand she had this big suitcase with her she was just coming across fifth

avenue and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her she could hardly drag

it when i got up closer i saw it was my old suitcase the one i used to use when i was at

whooton i couldn t figure out what the hell she was doing with it hi she said when

she got up close she was all out of breath from that crazy suitcase

i thought maybe you weren t coming i said what the hell s in that bag i don t

need anything i m just going the way i am i m not even taking the bags i got at the

station what the hellya got in there

she put the suitcase down my clothes she said i m going with you can i

okay

what i said i almost fell over when she said that i swear to god i did i got

sort of dizzy and i thought i was going to pass out or something again

i took them down the back elevator so charlene wouldn t see me it isn t heavy

all i have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and some

other things feel it it isn t heavy feel it once can t i go with you holden can t i

please

no shut up

i thought i was going to pass out cold i mean i didn t mean to tell her to shut up

and all but i thought i was going to pass out again

why can t i please holden i won t do anything i ll just go with you that s all

i won t even take my clothes with me if you don t want me to i ll just take my

you can t take anything because you re not going i m going alone so shut up

please holden please let me go i ll be very very very you won t even

you re not going now shut up gimme that bag i said i took the bag off her i

was almost all set to hit her i thought i was going to smack her for a second i really did

she started to cry

i thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all i thought you were

supposed to be benedict arnold in that play and all i said i said it very nasty

whuddaya want to do not be in the play for god s sake that made her cry even

harder i was glad all of a sudden i wanted her to cry till her eyes practically dropped

out i almost hated her i think i hated her most because she wouldn t be in that play any

more if she went away with me

come on i said i started up the steps to the museum again i figured what i d

do was i d check the crazy suitcase she d brought in the checkroom andy then she could

get it again at three o clock after school i knew she couldn t take it back to school with

her come on now i said

she didn t go up the steps with me though she wouldn t come with me i went up

anyway though and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it and then i came

down again she was still standing there on the sidewalk but she turned her back on me

when i came up to her she can do that she can turn her back on you when she feels like

it i m not going away anywhere i changed my mind so stop crying and shut up i

said the funny part was she wasn t even crying when i said that i said it anyway

though c mon now i ll walk you back to school c mon now you ll be late

she wouldn t answer me or anything i sort of tried to get hold of her old hand but

she wouldn t let me she kept turning around on me

didja have your lunch ya had your lunch yet i asked her

she wouldn t answer me all she did was she took off my red hunting hat the

one i gave her and practically chucked it right in my face then she turned her back on

me again it nearly killed me but i didn t say anything i just picked it up and stuck it in

my coat pocket

come on hey i ll walk you back to school i said

i m not going back to school

i didn t know what to say when she said that i just stood there for a couple of

minutes

you have to go back to school you want to be in that play don t you you want

to be benedict arnold don t you

no

sure you do certainly you do c mon now let s go i said in the first place

i m not going away anywhere i told you i m going home i m going home as soon as you

go back to school first i m gonna go down to the station and get my bags and then i m

gonna go straight

i said i m not going back to school you can do what you want to do but i m not

going back to chool she said so shut up it was the first time she ever told me to shut

up it sounded terrible god it sounded terrible it sounded worse than swearing she still

wouldn t look at me either and every time i sort of put my hand on her shoulder or

something she wouldn t let me

listen do you want to go for a walk i asked her do you want to take a walk

down to the zoo if i let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk will

you cut out this crazy stuff

she wouldn t answer me so i said it over again if i let you skip school this

afternoon and go for a little walk will you cut out the crazy stuff will you go back to

school tomorrow like a good girl

i may and i may not she said then she ran right the hell across the street

without even looking to see if any cars were coming she s a madman sometimes

i didn t follow her though i knew she d follow me so i started walking

downtown toward the zoo on the park side of the street and she started walking

downtown on the other goddam side of the street she wouldn t look over at me at all but

i could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where

i was going and all anyway we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo the only

thing that bothered me was when a double decker bus came along because then i couldn t

see across the street and i couldn t see where the hell she was but when we got to the

zoo i yelled over to her phoebe i m going in the zoo c mon now she wouldn t look

at me but i could tell she heard me and when i started down the steps to the zoo i turned

around and saw she was crossing the street and following me and all

there weren t too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day but

there were a few around the sea lions swimming pool and all i started to go by but old

phoebe stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting fed a guy was

throwing fish at them so i went back i figured it was a good chance to catch up with her

and all i went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hands on her shoulders

but she bent her knees and slid out from me she can certainly be very snotty when she

wants to she kept standing there while the sea lions were getting fed and i stood right

behind her i didn t put my hands on her shoulders again or anything because if i had she

really would ve beat it on me kids are funny you have to watch what you re doing

she wouldn t walk right next to me when we left the sea lions but she didn t walk

too far away she sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and i walked on the other

side it wasn t too gorgeous but it was better than having her walk about a mile away

from me like before we went up and watched the bears on that little hill for a while

but there wasn t much to watch only one of the bears was out the polar bear the other

one the brown one was in his goddam cave and wouldn t come out all you could see

was his rear end there was a little kid standing next to me with a cowboy hat on

practically over his ears and he kept telling his father make him come out daddy

make him come out i looked at old phoebe but she wouldn t laugh you know kids

when they re sore at you they won t laugh or anything

after we left the bears we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the

park and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from

somebody s taking a leak it was on the way to the carrousel old phoebe still wouldn t

talk to me or anything but she was sort of walking next to me now i took a hold of the

belt at the back of her coat just for the hell of it but she wouldn t let me she said keep

your hands to yourself if you don t mind she was still sore at me but not as sore as she

was before anyway we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could

start to hear that nutty music it always plays it was playing oh marie it played that

same song about fifty years ago when i was a little kid that s one nice thing about

carrousels they always play the same songs

i thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime old phoebe said it was the

first time she practically said anything she probably forgot she was supposed to be sore

at me

maybe because it s around christmas i said

she didn t say anything when i said that she probably remembered she was

supposed to be sore at me

do you want to go for a ride on it i said i knew she probably did when she

was a tiny little kid and allie and d b and i used to go to the park with her she was

mad about the carrousel you couldn t get her off the goddam thing

i m too big she said i thought she wasn t going to answer me but she did

no you re not go on i ll wait for ya go on i said we were right there then

there were a few kids riding on it mostly very little kids and a few parents were waiting

around outside sitting on the benches and all what i did was i went up to the window

where they sell the tickets and bought old phoebe a ticket then i gave it to her she was

standing right next to me here i said wait a second take the rest of your dough

too i started giving her the rest of the dough she d lent me

you keep it keep it for me she said then she said right afterward please

that s depressing when somebody says please to you i mean if it s phoebe or

somebody that depressed the hell out of me but i put the dough back in my pocket

aren t you gonna ride too she asked me she was looking at me sort of funny

you could tell she wasn t too sore at me any more

maybe i will the next time i ll watch ya i said got your ticket

yes

go ahead then i ll be on this bench right over here i ll watch ya i went over

and sat down on this bench and she went and got on the carrousel she walked all around

it i mean she walked once all the way around it then she sat down on this big brown

beat up looking old horse then the carrousel started and i watched her go around and

around there were only about five or six other kids on the ride and the song the

carrousel was playing was smoke gets in your eyes it was playing it very jazzy and

funny all the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring and so was old phoebe and i was

sort of afraid she d fall off the goddam horse but i didn t say anything or do anything

the thing with kids is if they want to grab the gold ring you have to let them do it and

not say anything if they fall off they fall off but it s bad if you say anything to them

when the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me you ride

once too this time she said

no i ll just watch ya i think i ll just watch i said i gave her some more of her

dough here get some more tickets

she took the dough off me i m not mad at you any more she said

i know hurry up the thing s gonna start again

then all of a sudden she gave me a kiss then she held her hand out and said

it s raining it s starting to rain

i know

then what she did it damn near killed me she reached in my coat pocket and

took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head

don t you want it i said

you can wear it a while

okay hurry up though now you re gonna miss your ride you won t get your

own horse or anything

she kept hanging around though

did you mean it what you said you really aren t going away anywhere are

you really going home afterwards she asked me

yeah i said i meant it too i wasn t lying to her i really did go home

afterwards hurry up now i said the thing s starting

she ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time

then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back then she got on it

she waved to me and i waved back

boy it began to rain like a bastard in buckets i swear to god all the parents and

mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel so they

wouldn t get soaked to the skin or anything but i stuck around on the bench for quite a

while i got pretty soaking wet especially my neck and my pants my hunting hat really

gave me quite a lot of protection in a way but i got soaked anyway i didn t care though

i felt so damn happy all of sudden the way old phoebe kept going around and around i

was damn near bawling i felt so damn happy if you want to know the truth i don t know

why it was just that she looked so damn nice the way she kept going around and around

in her blue coat and all god i wish you could ve been there

26

that s all i m going to tell about i could probably tell you what i did after i went

home and how i got sick and all and what school i m supposed to go to next fall after i

get out of here but i don t feel like it i really don t that stuff doesn t interest me too

much right now

a lot of people especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here keeps

asking me if i m going apply myself when i go back to school next september it s such a

stupid question in my opinion i mean how do you know what you re going to do till you

do it the answer is you don t i think i am but how do i know i swear it s a stupid

question

d b isn t as bad as the rest of them but he keeps asking me a lot of questions

too he drove over last saturday with this english babe that s in this new picture he s

writing she was pretty affected but very good looking anyway one time when she

went to the ladies room way the hell down in the other wing d b asked me what i

thought about all this stuff i just finished telling you about i didn t know what the hell to

say if you want to know the truth i don t know what i think about it i m sorry i told so

many people about it about all i know is i sort of miss everybody i told about even old

stradlater and ackley for instance i think i even miss that goddam maurice it s funny

don t ever tell anybody anything if you do you start missing everybody
